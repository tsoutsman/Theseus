<p><em>Note: for general info about Theseus and a quick start guide, see the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus#readme">top-level README</a>.</em></p>
<p>Theseus is a new OS written from scratch in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> to experiment with novel OS structure, better state management, and how to leverage <strong>intralingual design</strong> principles to shift OS responsibilities like resource management into the compiler.</p>

<h3 id="whats-in-a-name"><a class="header" href="#whats-in-a-name">What's in a name?</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned from Crete had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their places, in so much that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.
  —   <em>Plutarch, Theseus</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name &quot;Theseus&quot; was inspired by <em>The Ship of Theseus</em>, an ancient Greek metaphysical paradox and thought experiment that pondered: &quot;if you iteratively replace every individual piece of an object, is that re-built object still the same object?&quot;</p>
<p>Though we do not attempt to answer this question, we do wish to enable any and every OS component to be replaced — across all layers of the system — at runtime without rebooting. This goal of easy and arbitrary <em>live evolution</em> was (and still is) one of the original motivating factors behind Theseus.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="theseuss-design-and-structure"><a class="header" href="#theseuss-design-and-structure">Theseus's Design and Structure</a></h1>
<p>Theseus is a safe-language OS, in which everything runs in a single address space (SAS) and single privilege level (SPL). 
This includes everything from low-level kernel components to higher-level OS services, drivers, libraries, and more, all the way up to user applications.
Protection and isolation are provided by means of compiler- and language-ensured type safety and memory safety, as explained in a <a href="design/idea.html">later section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-many-small-cells"><a class="header" href="#structure-of-many-small-cells">Structure of many small <em>Cells</em></a></h2>
<p>Theseus is implemented as a collection of many small entities called <em><strong>cells</strong></em>, a software-defined unit of modularity that acts as the core building block of Theseus.
The cell concept is a term we coined to represent an individual entity of code and/or data that can be loaded into Theseus.
A cell is <em>not</em> a thread of execution, nor is it related to Rust's <code>std::cell</code> types. </p>
<h3 id="the-biological-cell-analogy"><a class="header" href="#the-biological-cell-analogy">The Biological Cell Analogy</a></h3>
<p>Cells in Theseus are inspired by and akin to biological cells in an organism, as they both have many attributes in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cells are the basic structural unit</li>
<li>Cells are tiny parts of a greater whole, yet remain distinct despite complex interactions and hierarchies</li>
<li>Cells each have widely differing roles, but can all be viewed under a single uniform abstraction</li>
<li>Cells have an identifiable boundary (<em>cell membrane</em> = public interface) that explicitly regulates what enters and exits (<em>selective permeability</em> = naming visibility)</li>
<li>Cells can be arbitrarily &quot;refactored&quot; into multiple different units (<em>meiosis</em>/<em>mitosis</em> = live evolution)</li>
<li>Cells can be replaced independently after failing or dying (<em>cell motility</em> = fault recovery)</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, we sometimes refer to Theseus as a <em><strong>cytokernel</strong></em>, in that it is composed of cells. This reinforces the distinction between the design of Theseus and that of other kernels, e.g., monolithic kernels, microkernels, multikernels, etc. <a href="design/design.html#comparison-with-other-os-designs">Read more here</a>. </p>
<h3 id="cell--crate"><a class="header" href="#cell--crate">Cell ≈ Crate</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there is a one-to-one relationship between a <em>cell</em> and a Rust <em>crate</em>. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-01-packages-and-crates.html">crate</a> is Rust's project container that consists of source code and a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html">dependency manifest</a> file. The crate also serves as Rust's translation unit (elementary unit of compilation); in Theseus we configure each Rust crate to be built into a single <code>.o</code> object file (a relocatable ELF file). </p>
<p>Thus, the <em>cell</em> abstraction is always present in Theseus, but takes different forms as shown in the below diagram. </p>
<ul>
<li>At implementation time, a cell is a crate.</li>
<li>After compile (build) time, a cell is a single <code>.o</code> object file.</li>
<li>At runtime, a cell 🄲 is a structure that contains the set of sections 🅂 from its crate object file, which have been dynamically loaded and linked into memory, as well as metadata about the inter-dependencies between it and others.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="design/../images/cell_consistency.svg" alt="Theseus's cell abstraction is present across implementation, build, and runtime" /></p>
<p>In Theseus, the metadata stored for each cell is defined by <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/crate_metadata/index.html">the <code>kernel/crate_metadata</code> crate</a>, which includes two main types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LoadedCrate</code>, which represents a single crate loaded into memory and linked against other loaded crates. The <code>LoadedCrate</code> owns the memory regions holding its sections, along with other metadata about sections and symbols in that crate.</li>
<li><code>LoadedSection</code>, which represents an individual section within a loaded crate, as specified in its object file. A <code>LoadedSection</code> comprises several main items:
<ul>
<li>The section <em>type</em>, e.g., <code>.text</code> (an executable function), <code>.rodata</code> (constant data), <code>.data</code>/<code>.bss</code> (read-write data)</li>
<li>Outgoing dependencies: the list of other sections from other crates that this section depends on (and links against).</li>
<li>Incoming dependencies: the list of other sections from other crates that depend on (link against) this section. </li>
<li>References to its containing &quot;parent&quot; crate and location within that crate's memory region where this section is loaded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that dependencies are tracked on a fine-grained, per-section basis in order to facilitate challenging OS goals like live evolution at runtime, system flexibility, fault recovery, and more. 
Dependencies are derived from relocation entries specified in the <code>.rela.*</code> sections in the ELF object file. This is much more precise than deriving dependencies from crate-level <code>Cargo.toml</code> manifests.</p>
<p>Each cell is loaded and linked into a <em>namespace</em>, which we refer to as a <code>CellNamespace</code> or <code>CrateNamespace</code>, which represents a true namespace of all of the publicly-visible symbols that are exposed by the cells within it. Namespaces are useful for quick dependency (symbol) resolution during dynamic linking, and also play a key role in the above system goals, especially flexibility, as they can be used to efficiently realize multiple distinct <em>OS personalities</em> to serve different applications with disparate needs.</p>
<p><img src="design/../images/metadata_tree.svg" alt="A simple CrateNamespace showing three crates with sections that depend on each other" /></p>
<p>The above diagram depicts a simple set of three crates whose sections depend upon each other and are thus linked into a single namespace. The <code>MappedPages</code> (MP) objects are Theseus's abstraction of owned memory regions.  <!-- TODO: link to memory.md --></p>
<h2 id="comparison-with-other-os-designs"><a class="header" href="#comparison-with-other-os-designs">Comparison with other OS designs</a></h2>
<p>The below figure shows the distinction between the structure of existing OS/kernel designs and Theseus. </p>
<p><img src="design/../images/kernel_structure.svg" alt="Existing OS designs vs. Theseus" /></p>
<p><strong>Monolithic OSes</strong> are the most common, including Linux and other Unix-like OSes and most commercial systems like Windows and macOS. 
In a monolithic OS, all kernel components exist and run in a single kernel address space, meaning that intra-kernel communication is fast and efficient: simply use function calls and shared memory accesses. 
However, monolithic OSes are less resilient to failures in the kernel, as any crash in kernel space (such as a buggy driver) can bring down the entire system. 
Applications must use system calls to ask the kernel to perform privileged operations on their behalf, requiring a privilege mode switch. </p>
<p><strong>Microkernel OSes</strong> are less common, but still widespread in certain computing domains where reliability is key, such as embedded systems. 
Microkernels move as much kernel functionality as possible into separate user space &quot;system server&quot; processes, leaving the kernel itself very small. 
This improves resiliency, as each kernel entity executes in user space in its own address space; if one crashes, the rest of the system can continue execution by restarting the failed system process. 
However, microkernels are less efficient: all inter-entity functionality requires Inter-Process Communication (IPC), requiring costly context switches and mode switches. </p>
<p><strong>Multikernel OSes</strong> offer high scalability to manycore hardware architectures by running a separate instance of a small kernel replicated across each hardware core. Depending on the underlying hardware, system service processes may also be replicated redundantly across (subsets of) cores to improve performance by reducing contention. They typically borrow standard OS interfaces and abstractions from monolithic and microkernel systems, though presenting a standard shared memory abstraction can harm performance.</p>
<p><strong>Theseus OS</strong> does not base its structure on any aspect of the underlying hardware, unlike the above three system designs. Everything, including applications, system services, and core kernel components, exists and runs in a single address space and a single privilege level (in &quot;kernel space&quot;). 
The structure of Theseus is purely software-defined and based on the modularity concept of cells.
Thus, communication and shared memory access is efficient because isolation and protection are ensured by the compiler.
However, everything must be written in a safe language like Rust.
See <a href="design/idea.html">this section</a> for more about Theseus's safe-language OS design.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="source-code-organization"><a class="header" href="#source-code-organization">Source code organization</a></h1>
<p>Source code in the Theseus repository is categorized into three main folders:</p>

<h3 id="1-kernel"><a class="header" href="#1-kernel">1. Kernel</a></h3>
<p>Crates in the <code>kernel/</code> folder are considered to be &quot;first-party&quot; or &quot;privileged&quot; components that can use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html">unsafe code</a> if necessary, e.g., for directly interacting with hardware at the lowest levels of the OS. That being said, we go to great lengths to avoid unsafe code throughout all of Theseus. </p>
<p>Kernel crates cannot depend on any application crates; if they did, the application crate would be erroneously included and built into the kernel image. Kernel crates can depend on libs crates.</p>
<h3 id="2-applications"><a class="header" href="#2-applications">2. Applications</a></h3>
<p>Crates in the <code>applications/</code> folder are user applications that cannot use any unsafe code. 
Currently this consists mostly of simple utilities and command-line tools that are developed specifically for Theseus, as well as various small apps used to test functionality or run benchmarks for performance measurements.</p>
<p>Application crates can depend on both kernel crates, libs crates, and even other application crates, though the latter is not recommended. 
See <a href="design/../app/app.html">this section</a> for more details about how applications work and how to develop one.</p>
<p>In the future, we expect to restrict applications to depend only upon functions and types explicitly exposed through a dedicated library, i.e., <code>libtheseus</code>, but this is a future development.</p>
<h3 id="3-libs"><a class="header" href="#3-libs">3. Libs</a></h3>
<p>Crates in the <code>libs/</code> folder are standalone projects that <em>must not</em> depend on anything else in Theseus, such as kernel or application crates. They are intended to be re-used by other software projects and may eventually be refactored out of the Theseus repository. The <code>libs/</code> folder also includes some other repositories that we may have forked and modified for use by Theseus, often included as <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">git submodules</a>. </p>
<h3 id="other-folders"><a class="header" href="#other-folders">Other folders</a></h3>
<p>The other folders in the root of the repository are mostly build/configuration tools and scripts. Here's a quick rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>book</code>: contains the source code of this Theseus book, which you're currently reading.</li>
<li><code>cfg</code>: contains a project-wide configuration Makefile <code>Config.mk</code> and JSON files that specify the compiler target platform for various Theseus builds.</li>
<li><code>docker</code>: contains scripts and config files required to set up a basic Docker image that can be used to build and run Theseus.</li>
<li><code>scripts</code>: contains miscellaneous scripts for setting up a build environment, testing, debugging, etc.</li>
<li><code>tools</code>: contains custom Rust programs that run as part of Theseus's build process. See the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/tree/theseus_main/tools#readme">tools/README</a> file for more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-workspace"><a class="header" href="#project-workspace">Project Workspace</a></h2>
<p>All of the crates in the main <code>kernel</code> and <code>applications</code> folders are organized into a single-top level <em>workspace</em>, a way of using cargo (Rust's package manager and build tool) to build them all together into the same <code>target/</code> directory.
This ensures they can all be directly linked together against each other and that the dependencies between them will be resolved properly by the compiler and linker toolchains.</p>
<p>You can see how the members of this workspace are defined in the root <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/theseus_main/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> file, and how all other folders are ignored. This uses cargo's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html">virtual manifest</a> feature.</p>

<h2 id="external-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#external-dependencies">External dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Theseus does depend on many external, third-party crates that are hosted on the official <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> registry or on GitHub. This is currently allowed for all crates, no matter whether they are kernel, application, or libs crates. In the future, we may restrict or forbid which kinds of crates can be used by applications and whether they can expose unsafe code or certain underlying assembly instructions. </p>

<h2 id="initial-assembly-code"><a class="header" href="#initial-assembly-code">Initial assembly code</a></h2>
<p>The Theseus kernel takes over from the bootloader and first executes code in <em>32-bit protected mode</em>, which corresponds to the <code>start</code> function in <code>kernel/nano_core/src/boot/arch_x86_64/boot.asm</code>.
Currently we use GRUB configured as a legacy bootloader (non-UEFI) and Theseus expects to be booted by a <em>Multiboot2</em>-compliant bootloader.
In the future, we intend to add support for booting via the UEFI standard, especially on other architectures without a legacy BIOS.</p>
<p>After initializing a very simple page table and other miscellaneous hardware features, the assembly file <code>boot.asm</code> jumps to <code>long_mode_start</code>, which now runs <em>64-bit code</em> in long mode.
Then, it jumps to <code>start_high</code>, such that we're not running the base kernel image in the higher half (see more about <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Higher_Half_Kernel">higher-half kernels here</a>).
We then set up a new Global Descriptor Table (GDT), segmentation registers, and finally call the Rust code entry point <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/nano_core/index.html"><code>nano_core_start()</code></a> with the proper arguments. 
After calling <code>nano_core_start</code>, the assembly files are no longer used, and <code>nano_core_start</code> should never return.</p>
<h2 id="initial-rust-code-the-nano_core"><a class="header" href="#initial-rust-code-the-nano_core">Initial Rust code: the <code>nano_core</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>nano_core</code>, specifically <code>nano_core_start()</code>, is the first Rust code to run in Theseus. 
It performs a very minimal bootstrap/setup procedure, in which it performs the following duties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializes logging and a basic VGA text display, for the purpose of debugging.</li>
<li>Sets up simple CPU exception handlers, for the purpose of catching early errors. </li>
<li>Sets up a basic virtual memory environment.
<ul>
<li>This creates the first and only virtual address space and remaps all of the bootloader-loaded sections into that new single address space. </li>
<li>Importantly, Theseus doesn't depend on anything else from the bootloader after this point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Initializes the <code>mod_mgmt</code> subsystem, which creates the first <code>CrateNamespace</code> and allows other crates to be dynamically loaded. </li>
<li>Loads the invokes the <code>captain</code>, which handles the rest of the OS initialization procedures. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>nano_core</code> is quite general and minimalistic; it rarely needs to change. The majority of the OS-specific configuration and initialization happens in the <code>captain</code>, so changes should likely be made there.</p>
<h2 id="main-initialization-routine-the-captain"><a class="header" href="#main-initialization-routine-the-captain">Main Initialization routine: the <code>captain</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>captain</code> &quot;steers the ship&quot; of Theseus, meaning that it contains basic logic for initializing all of the other subsystems in the proper order and with the proper flow of data between them.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a single <code>captain</code> implementation in Theseus (for a standard x86_64 machine), which does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializes ACPI and APIC to discover multicore and other hardware configuration,</li>
<li>Sets up interrupt and exception handlers,</li>
<li>Sets up basic device drivers,</li>
<li>Spawns event handling threads,</li>
<li>Initializes the window manager and graphics subsystem,</li>
<li>Starts the first user application, which is currently a single terminal window.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end, the <code>captain</code> must enable interrupts to allow the system to schedule other tasks. 
It then falls into an idle loop that does nothing and will never be run again by the scheduler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: in the future, Theseus will add additional architecture-specific <code>captain</code>s for different platforms.</p>

<p>Theseus is a safe-language OS, meaning that it relies on type safety and memory safety guarantees from the Rust language and compiler to enforce protection and isolation between tasks and components. 
As such, it foregoes hardware protection, which generally results in higher efficiency due to the ability to bypass overhead stemming from switching privilege modes and address spaces. </p>
<p>This is possible only when all applications are written in safe Rust, which prevents them from circumventing any type-based restrictions to cause unintended or undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSa0gp8sbq8S9MB4V-FYjs6xJGIPm0fsZSVdtZ9U2bQWRX9gngwztXTIJiRwxtAosLWPk0v60abDMTU/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false">this presentation slide deck</a> to learn more about how we ensure protection and isolation in Theseus based on the foundation of Rust's type and memory safety guarantees.</p>
<p>For more details about Theseus's research merit and novel design principles, see our <a href="design/../misc/papers_presentations.html">selected list of papers and presentations here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pie-principle"><a class="header" href="#pie-principle">P.I.E. Principle</a></h2>
<p>The P.I.E. principle is one of the guiding lights in the design of Theseus and much of our other systems software research.
The main idea is that there are three pillars of computing goals, of which the hardware should be responsible for only two:</p>
<!-- cspell:disable -->
<ol>
<li><strong>P</strong>erformance</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>solation</li>
<li><strong>E</strong>fficiency</li>
</ol>
<!-- cspell:enable -->
<p>Traditionally, systems software designers have looked to hardware to provide all three -- high performance, strong isolation, and efficiency (low overhead). 
We believe that hardware cannot fully realize all three. The P.I.E. principle asserts that hardware should <em>only</em> be responsible for performance and efficiency, but should have <em>no role</em> (or a minimal role) in providing isolation, safety, and security.
Isolation should be the responsibility of software alone.</p>
<p>We sometimes refer to this as the <strong>PHIS</strong> principle: <strong>Performance</strong> in <strong>Hardware</strong>, <strong>Isolation</strong> in <strong>Software</strong>.</p>
<p><em>But why?</em></p>
<p>For one, speculative execution exploits like Meltdown and Spectre have shown that hardware-ensured isolation does not protect kernel data from untrusted user space applications to the extent we once thought. It is difficult if not impossible to verify the true behavior of closed-source hardware (CPU architectures), so we turn to open-source software instead, where the OS, compiler, language libraries, and more are subject to scrutiny and even formal verification. </p>
<p>In addition, modern languages like Rust are able to ensure type safety and memory safety at compile time, without the overhead of traditional safe/managed languages that rely upon inefficient garbage collection and transparent heap-based object management.
Thus, we can leverage these safety guarantees to ensure that compiled code does not violate isolation between tasks (threads of execution) and software modules without the need for significant runtime checks.</p>
<p>Theseus transcends the reliance on hardware to provide isolation, and completely foregoes hardware privilege levels (x86's Ring 0 vs. Ring 3 distinction) and multiple address spaces.
Instead, we run all code at Ring 0 in a single virtual address space, including user applications that are written in purely safe Rust.
This maximizes efficiency whilst preserving protection, because we can guarantee at compile time that a given application or kernel component cannot violate isolation between modules, rendering hardware privilege levels obsolete.
Theseus still does use virtual memory translation provided by the MMU, but simply for convenience and ease of memory management; it can be very difficult and inefficient to directly handle and allocate physical memory for applications, and also to find large contiguous chunks of physical memory. </p>
<h2 id="going-beyond-safety"><a class="header" href="#going-beyond-safety">Going beyond safety</a></h2>
<p>We show that it's possible to leverage safe languages and compilers to go much further than just basic isolation and memory safety.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="application-support-and-development"><a class="header" href="#application-support-and-development">Application Support and Development</a></h1>
<p>One of the unusual features of Theseus, compared to mainstream operating systems like Linux, is that safe applications are loaded into the same single address space as the rest of the OS and run at the same kernel privilege level. Below, we provide information about how such apps are supported by Theseus and how you can develop a new app.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-linking-and-loading-of-application-crates"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-linking-and-loading-of-application-crates">Dynamic Linking and Loading of Application Crates</a></h2>
<p>Applications are simply object files that are loaded into the  address space, just like any other kernel crate.
The only real distinction is that they must use only safe code (unsafe code is forbidden),
and they must expose a <strong>public</strong> entry point function named <code>main</code>, shown below.
If the <code>main</code> function is not <code>pub</code>, it may be removed by compiler optimizations or undiscoverable by the application loader code, 
causing the application crate to be non-runnable.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust no_run no_playground">pub fn main(args: Vec&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; isize { ... }
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that application-level <em>libraries</em> do not need to expose a <code>main</code> function;
only applications that intend to be run as binary executables do. </p>
<p>If you forget to include a <code>main()</code> function in your application, the crate manager in Theseus will load and link it successfully but fail to run it; a runtime error will be thrown. </p>
<h2 id="creating-and-building-a-new-application"><a class="header" href="#creating-and-building-a-new-application">Creating and building a new application</a></h2>
<p>Theseus's build system will automatically build any crates in the <code>applications/</code> directory, so all you have to do is place your new application crate there. 
The name of the directory holding your crate files <strong>must be the same</strong> as the name of the crate as specified in its Cargo.toml <code>name</code> field. </p>
<p>So, for example, you could create a new application crate called <code>my_app</code> with the following file structure:</p>
<pre><code>applications/
├── my_app
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
├── ...
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>applications/my_app/src/lib.rs</code> file contains the application code with at least a <code>fn main()</code> body (as shown above). 
The <code>applications/my_app/Cargo.toml</code> file <strong>must specify the same name as the containing directory</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;my_app&quot;
...
</code></pre>
<p>After building and running Theseus, you can type <code>my_app</code> into the Theseus shell to run the application as expected.</p>
<h2 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>See the many examples in the <code>applications/</code> directory. The <code>example</code> application is designed to serve as a starting point for your new application that you can easily duplicate. We offer a ported version of <code>getopts</code> to help parse command-line arguments. </p>
<h2 id="dependencies-how-to-use-os-functionality"><a class="header" href="#dependencies-how-to-use-os-functionality">Dependencies: how to use OS functionality</a></h2>
<p>Currently, applications can use any Theseus kernel crate as a direct dependency (via its <code>Cargo.toml</code> file). This is a temporary design choice to bridge the lack of a real standard library. </p>
<p>In the future, this will be replaced with <code>libtheseus</code> in combination with Rust's standard library, in which applications can <em>only</em> access the kernel functionality re-exported by <code>libtheseus</code> and any functionality offered by the Rust standard library, which has two benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications will not be able to access public but &quot;sensitive&quot; kernel functions unless they are explicitly made visible to applications via the <code>libtheseus</code> library.</li>
<li>Applications will not have to know which kernel crate provides a specific feature; they can simply depend on the single <code>libtheseus</code> crate to access any OS feature. Their dependency management will be very simple. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cargo"><a class="header" href="#cargo">Cargo</a></h3>
<p>Theseus uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">cargo</a>, Rust's package manager and build tool, to automatically manage dependencies and invoke the actual Rust compiler for us.
We utilize cargo's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html">workspace feature</a> with a virtual manifest to group all of the main crates together into a single top-level meta project, which significantly speeds up build times.
As such, the crates from the main repository folders (<code>kernel/</code> and <code>applications/</code>) and all of their dependencies are all compiled into a single <code>target/</code> folder.</p>
<p>The members of this workspace are defined in the root <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/theseus_main/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> manifest file, plus the list of other folders that should be ignored by cargo.</p>
<h3 id="makefiles"><a class="header" href="#makefiles">Makefiles</a></h3>
<p>Although we use cargo to build all Rust code, we still use <code>make</code> and Makefiles to handle high-level build tasks. You should never need to directly run <code>cargo</code> or <code>rustc</code> commands; go through <code>make</code> instead. </p>
<p>The top-level <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/theseus_main/Makefile">Makefile</a> essentially just invokes the Rust toolchain and compiler via <code>cargo</code>, then copies the compiled object files from the appropriate <code>target/</code> directory into the top-level <code>build/</code> directory, and finally generates a bootable <code>.iso</code> image using various bootloader tools, e.g., GRUB.</p>
<p>The only special build action the Makefile takes is to use the <code>nasm</code> assembler to compile the  architecture-specific assembly code in <code>nano_core/boot/</code>, and then fully link that against the <code>nano_core</code> into a separate static binary.</p>

<p>Theseus source code uses the standard Rust-provided <code>cfg</code> options for conditional compilation via build-time configuration. </p>
<p>We expose the ability to set this via the <code>THESEUS_CONFIG</code> environment variable, which can be set on the command line, in the Makefile itself, or in a Rust build script. </p>
<p>To set one or more cfg options on the command line, all cfg options must be specified in one quoted string, with each individual cfg option separated by whitespace. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">make run THESEUS_CONFIG=&quot;cfg_option_1 cfg_option_2&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how you would set cfg options in the Makefile. In this case, we set the same <code>cfg_option_1</code> whenever <code>make my_target</code> is executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mk">my_target : export override THESEUS_CONFIG += cfg_option_1

<p>A single line in the top-level <code>Makefile</code> converts the cfg options specified by <code>THESEUS_CONFIG</code> into Rust-known <code>--cfg</code> values that can be used with the standard Rust cfg attributes. 
That line, shown below, simply adds the &quot;--cfg&quot; prefix onto each whitespace-separated value in <code>THESEUS_CONFIG</code> and appends them all to the <code>RUSTFLAGS</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>Note: you can also add <code>--cfg XYZ</code> directly to <code>RUSTFLAGS</code> rather than use <code>THESEUS_CONFIG</code>.</p>

<h2 id="debug-vs-release-mode"><a class="header" href="#debug-vs-release-mode">Debug vs. Release Mode</a></h2>
<p>Theseus can be built in a variety of modes, but offers two presets: <strong>debug</strong> and <strong>release</strong> build modes.
By default, Theseus is built in release mode for usable performance within an emulator like QEMU.
To build in debug mode, set the <code>BUILD_MODE</code> environment variable when running <code>make</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">make run  BUILD_MODE=debug  [host=yes]
</code></pre>
<p>As with most languages, release mode in Rust is <em>way</em> faster, but can be difficult to debug with GDB.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Theseus runs <em>extremely</em> slowly when built in debug mode; only use it when necessary to debug tricky problems. You will definitely want to run debug builds of Theseus in QEMU using KVM, e.g., by using the above <code>host=yes</code> argument on the <code>make</code> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a special Makefile <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/theseus_main/cfg/Config.mk"><code>cfg/Config.mk</code></a> that contains the build mode options as well as other configuration options used in the kernel Makefile.</p>
<h2 id="static-build-time-linking-vs-dynamic-runtime-linking"><a class="header" href="#static-build-time-linking-vs-dynamic-runtime-linking">Static Build-time Linking vs. Dynamic Runtime Linking</a></h2>
<p>Theseus offers two primary forms of linking and packaging its compiled crates into an ISO image.
As depicted in the image below, the first (left side) is a conventional fully statically-linked build, as used in all other OSes,
while the second (right side) is a novel dynamic linking approach used for Theseus research. </p>
<p><img src="building/../images/boot_image.svg" alt="Standard Build-time Static Linking (left) vs. Theseus Dynamic Linking (right)" /></p>
<h3 id="standard-build-time-static-linking"><a class="header" href="#standard-build-time-static-linking">Standard build-time (static) linking</a></h3>
<p>By default, Theseus is built into a single kernel binary just like a regular OS, in which all <code>kernel</code> crates are linked into a single static library and then packaged into a bootable .iso file.
This is what happens when you run <code>make</code> as usual. </p>
<h3 id="dynamic-runtime-linking-loadable-mode"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-runtime-linking-loadable-mode">Dynamic runtime linking (<code>loadable</code> mode)</a></h3>
<p>However, the research version of Theseus uses full dynamic loading and linking for all crates (except the <code>nano_core</code>) to achieve its various goals of live evolution, availability through fault tolerance, flexibility, etc. 
Loading and linking of crates at runtime is precisely how Theseus achieves <em>runtime-persistent bounds</em>; the crate management subsystem knows where it loaded a given crate into memory and can therefore maintain metadata about each loaded crate to track its bounds and dependencies. </p>
<p>We refer to this as <code>loadable</code> mode, because crates are loaded at runtime (as cells) instead of being linked into a single static kernel binary.</p>
<p>To enable this, set the <code>THESEUS_CONFIG=&quot;loadable&quot;</code> option (or run <code>make loadable</code>, which sets this for you). This causes the following to occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Builds each crate into its own separate object file as normal, but does not link them all together. </li>
<li>Copies each crate's object file into the top-level build directory's module subdirectory (<code>build/grub-isofiles/modules</code>) such that each crate is a separate object file in the final <code>.iso</code> image.
<ul>
<li>The bootloader loads these object files into memory for us, which we discover and map into memory when initializing the crate management subsystem from the <code>nano_core</code>. This allows Theseus to see and load available crate object files at the very beginning of the OS boot-up without needing full support for a filesystem. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sets the <code>loadable</code> config option, which as seen in the <code>nano_core</code> (and other crates), will enable the <code>#![cfg(loadable)]</code> code blocks that dynamically load other crates rather than include them as static dependencies.
<ul>
<li>In <code>loadable</code> code blocks, the caller dynamically looks up the symbol for a given callee function and invokes it dynamically instead of directly calling it via a regular function call. This produces a &quot;soft dependency&quot; in the source code rather than a &quot;hard dependency&quot; that actually requires the callee crate to be statically linked to the caller crate.
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat similar to <code>dlopen()</code> and <code>dlsym()</code> for <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlsym.3.html">loading shared objects on Linux</a>, at least conceptually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Search the code base for <code>cfg(loadable)</code> and <code>cfg(not(loadable))</code> to see where else it is used. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="built-in-rust-cfg-and-target-options"><a class="header" href="#built-in-rust-cfg-and-target-options">Built-in Rust cfg and target options</a></h2>
<p>The <code>#[cfg()]</code> attribute and <code>cfg!()</code> macro can also be used with built-in cfg options set by the Rust compiler, for example, target-specific values. </p>
<p>For example, Theseus frequently uses options like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[cfg(target_arch = &quot;x86_64&quot;)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[cfg(target_feature = &quot;sse2&quot;)]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The advantage of these features is that they can also be used in <code>Cargo.toml</code> manifest files to conditionally set dependencies. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">## Only include the `core_simd` crate as a dependency when &quot;sse2&quot; is enabled.
[target.'cfg(target_feature = &quot;sse2&quot;)'.dependencies.core_simd]
...
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot use non-built-in cfg options to conditionally specify dependencies in <code>Cargo.toml</code> files, such as anything that comes from <code>THESEUS_CONFIG</code> values. </p>
<h2 id="using-cargo-features"><a class="header" href="#using-cargo-features">Using cargo <code>features</code></a></h2>
<p>Another option for configuration is to expose <code>features</code> from a given crate; <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html">read more about features here</a>. </p>
<p>Theseus does not use features extensively because it is structured as many small crates in one overarching virtual workspace. In this form, you cannot easily set one feature for a target crate across multiple dependent crates at the same time, e.g., using a single command-line argument; instead, you must individually change the Cargo.toml specification of <em>every single crate</em> that depends on that target crate. </p>
<p>Thus, we use the <code>cfg</code> blocks instead of <code>features</code>. </p>
<p>That being said, Theseus does choose which features it wants to use when bringing in dependencies on third-party crates, but this is minimal and only occurs for a few dependencies. Typically, features are only specified in order to choose a <code>no_std</code> version of a crate, i.e., telling that crate to use the Rust <code>core</code> library instead of the standard library.</p>

<h2 id="background-the-problem"><a class="header" href="#background-the-problem">Background: The Problem</a></h2>
<p>Because Rust currently <a href="https://slightknack.github.io/rust-abi-wiki/intro/intro.html">lacks a stable ABI</a>, there is no easy, stable, or safe way to integrate two or more separately-compiled Rust binaries together. 
By <em>integrate</em>, we mean the ability to have one binary depend upon or invoke another pre-built binary, such as an executable, statically-linked library, dynamically-linked shared object, etc. </p>
<p>There is another related problem that stems from how the Rust compiler appends unique IDs (metadata used by the compiler) to each compiled crate and each (non-mangled) symbol in those crates; this issue presents itself even in unlinked object files.</p>
<p>As an example, the <code>page_allocator</code> crate in Theseus will be compiled into an object file with a name like <code>page_allocator-c55b593144fe8446.o</code>, and the function <code>page_allocator::allocate_pages_at()</code> implemented and exposed by that crate will be emitted as the symbol <code>_ZN14page_allocator17allocate_pages_at17heb9fd5c4948b3ccfE</code>. </p>
<p>The values of both the crate's unique ID (<code>c55b593144fe8446</code>) and every symbol's unique ID (e.g., <code>heb9fd5c4948b3ccfE</code>) are deterministic, but depend on many factors. 
Those factors include the compiler version, the source directory, the target directory, and more. 
We sometimes refer to both of these unique IDs as a <em>hash</em> value since the compiler creates them by hashing together these various factors; how this hash is generated is considered opaque and liable to change, thus we treat it as a black box. </p>
<p>Theseus loads and links crate object files dynamically at runtime. 
When we build all of the Theseus kernel crates together into a single target directory (<a href="building/building.html#cargo">read more here</a>), the unique IDs/hash values appended to every crate name and symbol are based on the build machine's source and target directories (among other factors). 
A running instance of Theseus will have a single instance of the <code>page_allocator</code> crate loaded into memory and expect all other crates to depend upon that instance, meaning that they should be compiled to expect linkage against its specifically-hashed symbols, e.g., <code>_ZN14page_allocator17allocate_pages_at17heb9fd5c4948b3ccfE</code>.</p>
<p>If you separately compile another crate <code>my_crate</code> that depends on the exact same set of Theseus kernel crates, cargo will recompile all Theseus crates <em>from source</em> into that new target directory, resulting in the recompiled object files and their symbols having completely different unique ID hashes from the original Theseus instance. 
As such, when attempting to load <code>my_crate</code> into that already-running prebuilt instance of Theseus, it will fail to load and link because that version of <code>my_crate</code> will depend on differently-hashed crates/symbols, e.g., it may depend upon the symbol <code>_ZN14page_allocator17allocate_pages_at17hd64cba3bd66ea729E</code> instead of <code>_ZN14page_allocator17allocate_pages_at17heb9fd5c4948b3ccfE</code> (note the different appended hash values).</p>
<p>Therefore, the <strong>real problem</strong> is that there is no supported method to tell cargo that it should build a crate against a prebuilt set of dependencies. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1139">See this GitHub issue for more</a> about why this feature would be useful, but why it still isn't supported (hint: no stable Rust ABI).</p>
<h3 id="a-bad-unsafe-solution"><a class="header" href="#a-bad-unsafe-solution">A Bad, Unsafe Solution</a></h3>
<p>Technically, we could solve this by using an existing non-Rust stable ABI, like the C language ABI. 
This would entail defining/exposing Rust functions, data, and types in a C-compatible way such that they are compatible with the C ABI (its expected struct memory layout and calling convention).
Unfortunately, this necessitates the usage of unsafe FFI code blocks (via C-style extern functions) to connect two separate bodies of fully-safe Rust code, which is both dumb and tedious. </p>
<p>In the above example, instead of simply invoking <code>page_allocator::allocate_pages_at()</code> directly, we would need to export the appropriate wrapper functions like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust no_run no_playground">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// in `page_allocator`
#[no_mangle]
pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn allocate_pages_at(num_pages: usize, ...) -&gt; ... {
    page_allocator::allocate_pages_at(num_pages, ...)
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>and then invoke it using unsafe FFI code blocks like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust no_run no_playground">// in `my_crate` 
extern &quot;C&quot; {
    fn allocate_pages_at(num_pages: usize, ...);
}
fn main() {
    unsafe {
        allocate_pages_at(15, ...);
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that many details are omitted above; while these code wrappers and bindings can be autogenerated, unsafety cannot be avoided. </p>
<p>Surely we can do better!</p>
<h2 id="solution-theseus_cargo-for-out-of-tree-builds"><a class="header" href="#solution-theseus_cargo-for-out-of-tree-builds">Solution: <code>theseus_cargo</code> for out-of-tree builds</a></h2>
<p>A superior solution is to &quot;trick&quot; the Rust compiler into using the prebuilt crates from an existing build of Theseus.
To this end, we've created <code>theseus_cargo</code>, a custom build tool and wrapper around cargo that resolves an out-of-tree crate's dependencies on in-tree Theseus crates using their prebuilt objects instead of rebuilding them from source.</p>
<p>This is realized in two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generating the prebuilt dependencies while building Theseus's (in-tree) kernel crates,</li>
<li>Correctly building the out-of-tree crate(s) against those prebuilt Theseus crates. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-generating-the-set-of-prebuilt-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#1-generating-the-set-of-prebuilt-dependencies">1. Generating the set of prebuilt dependencies</a></h3>
<p>To create a set of dependency files understood by Rust's compiler toolchain, the main top-level Makefile invokes another custom build tool, a Rust program called <code>copy_latest_crate_objects</code> found in the <code>tools/</code> directory. 
It is invoked like so (details omitted):</p>
<pre><code class="language-mk">cargo run ... tools/copy_latest_crate_objects --  \
    --input  &quot;target/.../deps&quot;                    \
    --output-deps  &quot;build/deps/&quot;                  \
    --output-sysroot  &quot;build/deps/sysroot/&quot;       \
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>The arguments above specify that we wish to</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the Rust-produced build artifacts (compiled crates) in the <code>target/.../deps</code> directory as input, and then</li>
<li>Copy them into the <code>build/deps/</code> output directory.</li>
<li>Also, copy the prebuilt Rust fundamental libraries (<code>core</code>, <code>alloc</code>) that were cross-compiled into the Theseus platform-specific sysroot folder into <code>build/deps/sysroot/</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterwards, the <code>build/deps/</code> directory contains all prebuilt dependencies needed to compile an out-of-tree crate against the existing build of Theseus, with all the properly versioned (correctly hashed) crates and symbols.
This tool also generates a <code>TheseusBuild.toml</code> file that describes the parameters of this build of Theseus, such that it can be replicated by <code>theseus_cargo</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">target = &quot;x86_64-unknown-theseus&quot;
rustflags = &quot;--emit=obj -C debuginfo=2 -C code-model=large -C relocation-model=static -D unused-must-use -Z merge-functions=disabled -Z share-generics=no&quot;
cargoflags = &quot;--release&quot;
host_deps = &quot;./host_deps&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-building-other-rust-code-against-the-prebuilt-theseus-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#2-building-other-rust-code-against-the-prebuilt-theseus-dependencies">2. Building other Rust code against the prebuilt Theseus dependencies</a></h3>
<p>With the contents of <code>build/deps/</code> described above, we can invoke <code>theseus_cargo</code> to build the new out-of-tree crate in a separate compilation instance. 
The <code>theseus_cargo</code> tool is a Rust program that invokes cargo, captures its verbose output, and then modifies and re-runs the <code>rustc</code> commands issued by cargo to use the prebuilt crates to fulfill the out-of-tree crate's dependencies. 
Those prebuilt crates are a set of dependencies, namely <code>.rmeta</code> and <code>.rlib</code> files, that are understood by the Rust compiler's internal metadata parsers.</p>
<p>The main modifications <code>theseus_cargo</code> makes to rustc commands is to replace the <code>&lt;values&gt;</code> of the following arguments with the paths and names of the prebuilt Theseus crates in <code>/build/deps/</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-L dependency=&lt;dir&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>--extern &lt;crate_name&gt;=&lt;crate_file&gt;.rmeta</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If a given rustc command has any arguments that need to be changed, <code>theseus_cargo</code> reissues that command.</p>
<p>Currently, to use <code>theseus_cargo</code>, it must be compiled and installed from source:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo install --path=&quot;tools/theseus_cargo&quot; --root=$INSTALL_DIR
</code></pre>
<p>Then, it can be invoked just like <code>cargo build</code>, e.g., to build a crate against the prebuilt dependencies in the input folder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$INSTALL_DIR/theseus_cargo --input &quot;build/deps/&quot;  build
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, <code>theseus_cargo</code> prints <em><strong>very verbose</strong></em> output and will show a lot of irrelevant warning and log statements describing what it is doing. If the out-of-tree crate was successfully built, it will finally print something like &quot;Ran rustc command (modified for Theseus) successfully&quot; before exiting successfully with exit code 0.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/theseus_main/tools/theseus_cargo/src/main.rs"><code>tools/theseus_cargo</code> source code</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The approach of capturing and modifying rustc commands using verbose output from cargo is obviously not ideal, but there is currently no other supported way to obtain this info because <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5579">cargo is removing its <code>--build-plan</code> option</a>.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> Support for building C programs atop Theseus is experimental and liable to change at any moment.</p>

<p>As Theseus is a safe-language OS that runs all code in a single address space (SAS) and single privilege level (SPL),
<strong>there is no guarantee</strong> of safety, protection, or isolation when running any other unsafe or non-Rust code directly atop Theseus. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have introduced experimental support for building C programs atop Theseus; proceed at your own risk. </p>
<h2 id="prerequisites"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>You must have a version of GCC and Binutils cross-compiled for Theseus, e.g., the <code>x86_64-elf</code> target with <code>red-zone</code> usage disabled. </p>
<p>To make things easy, we have written <a href="c/cross_compiler.html">an automated script and a guide</a> on how to build and install all necessary tools.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>x86_64-elf-*</code> binaries must be on your system PATH before running any of the following gcc commands. </p>

<p>See the <code>c_test</code> directory for an example dummy C program. All it does is run a simple <code>main()</code> function that returns a constant value. </p>
<p>In short, building a C program requires the following steps:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">make         # 1. Build Theseus OS itself
make tlibc   # 2. Build tlibc, Theseus's libc
make c_test  # 3. Build a sample C program

</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-a-c-program"><a class="header" href="#running-a-c-program">Running a C program</a></h2>
<p>Once the C program's executable ELF file has been packaged into Theseus's ISO image, you can execute it in Theseus using the <code>loadc</code> application. Executables are automatically placed in the <code>_executable</code> namespace folder by default, so run the following in Theseus's shell:</p>
<pre><code>loadc /namespaces/_executable/dummy_works
</code></pre>
<p>You should observe the return value displayed on the shell GUI, as well as various log messages that show output from tlibc alongside those from Theseus's kernel. </p>

<p>You can obtain it from many mirrors online, such as these:</p>

<p>Now that we have a standalone build of gcc/binutils that is independent from the one installed by your host system's package manager, we can use that to build a version of gcc that inherently performs cross-compilation for a specific target, in this case, our Theseus <code>x86_64-elf</code> target.</p>
<p>Note: these instructions are based on <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler#The_Build">this tutorial from the OS dev wiki</a>.</p>
<p>First, create a directory for the cross compiler to be built and installed into, e.g., <code>$DEST/cross</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir $DEST/cross
export PREFIX=&quot;$DEST/cross&quot;
export TARGET=x86_64-elf
export PATH=&quot;$PREFIX/bin:$PATH&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Second, re-build the same binutils package as above, but in a way that configures it to target Theseus. </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">../binutils-2.35.1/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=&quot;$PREFIX&quot; --with-sysroot --disable-nls --disable-werror
make -j$(nproc)
make install
</code></pre>
<p>Confirm that your new cross-compiler binutils package exists and is on your system PATH:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">which --$TARGET-as 
</code></pre>
<p>should output something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>/home/my_username/opt/cross/bin/x86_64-elf-as
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Then go back to the <code>$SRC</code> directory and build a version of gcc that cross compiles C/C++ programs to Theseus.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">mkdir cross-build-gcc
cd cross-build-gcc
../gcc-10.2.0/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=&quot;$PREFIX&quot; --disable-nls --enable-languages=c,c++ --without-headers
make all-gcc -j$(nproc)
make all-target-libgcc -j$(nproc) 
make install-gcc

<p>Before moving on, let's check to make sure our cross-compiled gcc is working.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$DEST/cross/bin/$TARGET-gcc --version

<p>This should print out some information about your newly-built gcc. Add the <code>-v</code> flag to dump out even more info. </p>

<p>Importantly, we must disable the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">red zone</a> in gcc entirely.

Thus, in order to avoid <code>libgcc</code> functions invalidly using the non-existing red zone in Theseus, we have to build a no-red-zone version of <code>libgcc</code> in order to successfully build and link C programs for Theseus,  without <code>libgcc</code>'s methods trying to write to the red zone. </p>
<p>Note: instructions were adapted from <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Libgcc_without_red_zone">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3 id="adjusting-the-gcc-config"><a class="header" href="#adjusting-the-gcc-config">Adjusting the GCC config</a></h3>
<p>First, create a new file within the gcc source tree at <code>$SRC/gcc-10.2.0/gcc/config/i386</code>.<br />

<pre><code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS += mno-red-zone

<p>Yes, even though we're building for <code>x86_64</code>, we put it in the original x86 architecture config folder called <code>i386</code>.</p>
<p>Then, instruct gcc's build process to use that new <code>multilib</code> configuration. Open the file <code>$SRC/gcc-10.2.0/gcc/config</code> and search for the following configuration lines, which starts on Line 1867 (for gcc-10.2.0):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Warning:</em> Support for building C programs atop Theseus is experimental and liable to change at any moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theseus's libc implementation, <code>tlibc</code>, is a work in progress and currently a proof-of-concept library that's missing most standard libc functionality. </p>
<h2 id="building-tlibc-in-a-theseus-compatible-way"><a class="header" href="#building-tlibc-in-a-theseus-compatible-way">Building tlibc in a Theseus-compatible way</a></h2>
<p>Most standard library and libc implementations are built as fully-linked static or dynamic libraries; in Rust terms, this corresponds to the <code>staticlib</code> or <code>cdylib</code> crate type (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html">see more about crate types and linkage here</a>).</p>
<p>This doesn't work well for Theseus for a few reasons. 
First, because Theseus runs everything in a single privilege level, there is no clear point of separation between the lowest level of user code and the highest level of kernel code.
In conventional OSes, standard libraries use the <em>system call</em> interface to separate their code from the rest of the OS. 
Therein, building against a specific OS platform is easy -- you simply define the system call interface and compile against any necessary header files.
There is no complex linking that needs to occur, since the lowest level of the dependency chain ends at the <code>syscall</code> assembly instruction, which makes the library self-contained from the linker's point of view.</p>
<p>Second, Theseus dynamically links raw object files at runtime, so we cannot easily create a fully statically-linked binary for a standalone C library because it won't know where its dependencies will exist in memory.
Again, this is not a problem for standard libc implementations since it doesn't need to directly link against each specific syscall handler function. </p>
<p>Thus, we use the standard <code>rlib</code> crate type for <code>tlibc</code> and perform partial linking of the raw compiled object files ourselves. </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ld -r -o tlibc/target/.../tlibc.o  tlibc/target/.../deps/*.o
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, we could also use <code>ar</code> to create an archive of all of the object files, as shown below; there's not much of a functional difference between the two approaches, but some build tools prefer <code>.a</code> archives instead of a <code>.o</code> object files. </p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ar -rcs tlibc/target/.../libtlibc.a  tlibc/target/.../deps/*.o 
</code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>theseus_cargo</code> tool (<a href="c/../building/rust_builds_out_of_tree.html">as described here</a>) to ensure that <code>tlibc</code> is compiled against and depends on the correct version of crates and symbols from an existing Theseus build. </p>
<h2 id="using-tlibc"><a class="header" href="#using-tlibc">Using tlibc</a></h2>
<p>Once we have the <code>tlibc.o</code> (or <code>.a</code>) file, we can use that to satisfy any C program's dependencies on basic libc functions/data.</p>
<p><a href="c/compiler_linker.html">The next section</a> describes how we use the <code>tlibc</code> file to build a standalone C executable that can run atop Theseus.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compiling-and-linking-c-programs"><a class="header" href="#compiling-and-linking-c-programs">Compiling and Linking C programs</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Warning:</em> Support for building C programs atop Theseus is experimental and liable to change at any moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, we use a custom form of &quot;split&quot; linking that is both fully-static at compile time <em>and</em> partially-dynamic at runtime.</p>
<h2 id="1-full-static-linking-at-build-time"><a class="header" href="#1-full-static-linking-at-build-time">1. Full static linking at build time</a></h2>
<p>This procedure can be broken down into the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile <code>tlibc</code> as a standard Rust crate into a series of object files, </li>
<li>Combine or link those tlibc-related as a single archive or object file,</li>
<li>Compile the basic C program, e.g., <code>dummy.c</code>,</li>
<li>Statically link the C program to the prebuilt <code>tlibc</code> object to produce a standalone executable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two steps were <a href="c/tlibc.html">described previously</a>; the latter two are described below.</p>
<p>To build and link a dummy C program to tlibc, the invocation of <code>gcc</code> currently requires several arguments to customize the compiler's behavior as well as its usage of the <code>ld</code> linker. The key arguments are shown and described below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">x86_64-elf-gcc                             \
    -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostartfiles  \
    -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections    \
    -mcmodel=large                         \
    -Wl,-gc-sections                       \
    -Wl,--emit-relocs                      \
    -o dummy_works                         \
    path/to/crtbegin.o                     \
    dummy.c                                \
    path/to/tlibc.o                        \
    path/to/crtend.o
</code></pre>
<p>The most important arguments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-mno-red-zone</code>, <code>-mcmodel=large</code>:  match Theseus's Rust-side compiler configuration so the C code can properly invoke the Rust code.</li>
<li><code>-Wl,--emit-relocs</code>: include details in the ELF executable (<code>.rela</code> sections) about the specific relocation actions the linker performed.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the above gcc command, we have a standalone executable ELF file <code>dummy_works</code>.</p>
<h2 id="2-partial-dynamic-re-linking-at-runtime"><a class="header" href="#2-partial-dynamic-re-linking-at-runtime">2. Partial dynamic re-linking at runtime</a></h2>
<p>The ELF executable <code>dummy_works</code> can immediately be loaded and executed atop Theseus, but it won't necessarily work properly and execute as expected. 
This is because it was fully statically linked, meaning that the executable includes duplicate instances of the same data and function sections that already exist in the loaded instances of Theseus crates in memory (cells).</p>
<p>Most importantly, those data sections represent system-wide singleton states (<code>static</code> variables in Rust) that have <em>already been initialized</em> and are in active use by all other Theseus components. 
Thus, the data instances packaged into the executable have <em>not</em> been initialized and can't safely be used. 
Using those sections would result in multiple copies of data that's supposed to be a system-wide singleton; this would be bad news for most Theseus components, e.g., frame allocator's system-wide list of free physical memory. </p>
<p>To solve this problem, we re-perform (overwrite) all of the relocations in the executable ELF file such that they refer to the <em>existing sections</em> already loaded into Theseus instead of the new uninitialized/unused ones in the executable itself. 
This only applies for sections that already exist in Theseus; references to new sections that are unique to the executable are kept intact, of course.
The relocation information is encoded into the ELF file itself as standard <code>.rela.*</code> sections via the <code>--emit-relocs</code> linker argument shown above.</p>
<p>This procedure is currently performed by the <code>loadc</code> application; it also handles loading the ELF executable segments (program headers) and managing their metadata. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="overview-of-key-subsystems"><a class="header" href="#overview-of-key-subsystems">Overview of Key Subsystems</a></h1>
<p>Like every OS, Theseus's functionality can be categorized into multiple <em>subsystems</em>, which each implement a different core OS feature. 
This section covers the design and implementation of key subsystems in Theseus, such as memory management, multitasking support, graphical displays, etc.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="memory-management-in-theseus"><a class="header" href="#memory-management-in-theseus">Memory Management in Theseus</a></h1>
<p>Memory management is one of the most unique aspects of Theseus's design, compared to how other OSes manage memory. </p>
<h2 id="single-virtual-address-space"><a class="header" href="#single-virtual-address-space">Single <em>Virtual</em> Address Space</a></h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, Theseus is a Single Address Space (SAS) OS, meaning that all kernel entities, libraries, and applications are loaded into and execute within a single address space. This is possible due to careful design combined with isolation based on Rust's type and memory safety instead of hardware-based memory protection.</p>
<p>That being said, Theseus's single address space is a <em>virtual</em> address space, not a physical address space; 
all Rust-level pointers that are dereferenced and addresses that are accessed are virtual addresses. 
Although Theseus could technically operate directly on physical memory addresses without using virtual memory at all, the use of virtual addresses affords us many benefits, e.g., easier contiguous memory allocation, guard pages to catch stack overflow, etc. </p>
<h2 id="types-and-terminology"><a class="header" href="#types-and-terminology">Types and Terminology</a></h2>
<p>Theseus uses precise, specific terminology and dedicated types to avoid confusion and correctness errors related to mixing up physical and virtual memory.
The following table concisely describes the basic memory types with links to their source-level documentation:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Description of Type</th><th>Virtual Memory Type</th><th>Physical Memory Type</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<h3 id="addresses"><a class="header" href="#addresses">Addresses</a></h3>
<p>In Theseus, virtual and physical addresses are given dedicated, separate types that are <strong>not interoperable</strong>. 
This is to ensure that programmers are intentional about which type of address they are using and cannot accidentally mix them up.
The constructors for <code>VirtualAddress</code> and <code>PhysicalAddress</code> also ensure that you cannot create an invalid address and that all addresses used across the system are canonical in form, which is based on the hardware architecture's expectations.</p>
<p>For 64-bit architectures, the set of possible <code>VirtualAddress</code>es goes from <code>0</code> to <code>0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</code>, and all canonical addresses in that range can be used.
However, while the set of possible <code>PhysicalAddress</code> has the same range, there are large &quot;holes&quot; across the physical address space that correspond to non-existent, unusable physical addresses; the locations of specific holes is hardware-dependent and generally not known until the OS asks the bootloader at runtime. 
Thus, you can be guaranteed that every canonical virtual address actually exists and is usable, but not every canonical physical address.</p>
<h3 id="pages-frames-and-ranges"><a class="header" href="#pages-frames-and-ranges"><code>Page</code>s, <code>Frame</code>s, and ranges</a></h3>
<p>A chunk of virtual memory is called a <code>Page</code>, while a chunk of physical memory is called a <code>Frame</code>. 
<code>Page</code>s and <code>Frame</code>s have the same size, typically 4KiB (4096 bytes) but ultimately dependent upon hardware.
These chunks are the smallest elementary unit that the hardware's Memory Management Unit (MMU) can operate on, i.e., they are indivisible from the hardware's point of view. 
In other words, the MMU hardware cannot map any chunk of memory smaller than a single <code>Page</code> to any chunk of memory smaller than a single <code>Frame</code>. </p>
<p>A <code>Page</code> has a starting <code>VirtualAddress</code> and an ending <code>VirtualAddress</code>; for example, a <code>Page</code> may start (inclusively) at address <code>v0x5000</code> and end (exclusively) at <code>v0x6000</code> 
Similarly, a <code>Frame</code> has a starting <code>PhysicalAddress</code> and an ending <code>PhysicalAddress</code>, for example from <code>p0x101000</code> to <code>p0x102000</code>.
A <code>Page</code> can be said to contain a <code>VirtualAddress</code> within its bounds, and likewise a <code>Frame</code> can be said to contain a <code>PhysicalAddress</code>.
Although <code>Page</code>s and <code>Frame</code>s have internal numbers, we typically identify them by their starting address, e.g., &quot;the page starting at <code>v0x9000</code>&quot; instead of &quot;page 9&quot;.
Intrinsically, <code>Page</code>s have no relation to <code>PhysicalAddress</code>es, and similarly, <code>Frame</code>s have no relation to <code>VirtualAddress</code>es.</p>
<p>For convenience, Theseus provides dedicated &quot;range&quot; types to represent a contiguous range of virtual <code>Page</code>s or physical <code>Frame</code>s. 
They are inclusive ranges on both sides; see Rust's built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/struct.RangeInclusive.html"><code>RangeInclusive</code></a> type for more information.
These types implement the standard Rust <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html"><code>Iterator</code></a> trait, allowing for easy iteration over all pages or frames in a range.</p>
<p>Theseus employs macros to generate the implementation of the above basic types,
as they are symmetric across the virtual memory and physical memory categories.
This ensures that the <code>VirtualAddress</code> and <code>PhysicalAddress</code> have the same interface (public methods); the same is true for <code>Page</code> and<code>Frame</code>, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="page-and-frame-allocators"><a class="header" href="#page-and-frame-allocators">Page and Frame allocators</a></h3>
<p>Theseus's <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/page_allocator/index.html">page allocator</a> and <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/frame_allocator/index.html">frame allocator</a> are effectively identical in their design and implementation, but the former allocates virtual memory <code>Page</code>s while the latter allocates physical memory <code>Frame</code>s.</p>
<p>While the underlying implementation may change over time, the general interface for both allocators is the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>You can request a new allocation of one or more <code>Page</code>s or <code>Frame</code>s at any address, which will only fail if there is no remaining virtual or physical memory. </li>
<li>You can request that allocation to start at the <code>Page</code> or <code>Frame</code> containing a specific address, but it will fail if the <code>Page</code> or <code>Frame</code> containing that address has already been allocated.</li>
<li>You can also specify the minimum number of bytes that the new allocation must cover, which will be rounded up to the nearest <code>Page</code> or <code>Frame</code> granularity.
<ul>
<li>These allocators cannot allocate anything smaller than a single <code>Page</code> or <code>Frame</code>; for smaller allocations, you would want to use dynamically-allocated heap memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both allocators support the concept of &quot;reserved&quot; regions of memory, which are only usable by specific kernel entities, e.g., memory handling functions that run at early boot/init time.
<ul>
<li>The <code>frame_allocator</code> uses reserved regions to preserve some ranges of physical memory for specific usage, e.g., memory that contains early boot information from the bootloader, or memory that contains the actual executable kernel code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both allocators also support early memory allocation before the heap is set up, allowing Theseus to bootstrap its dynamic memory management system with a series of small statically-tracked allocations in a static array.</li>
</ul>
<p>The page allocator and frame allocator in Theseus do not directly allow you to <em>access</em> memory; you still must <em>map</em> the virtual <code>Page</code>(s) to the physical <code>Frame</code>(s) in order to access the memory therein.
We use more dedicated types to represent this, described below.</p>
<p>In Theseus, like other OSes, there is a single frame allocator because there is only one set of physical memory -- the actual system RAM connected to your computer's motherboard. 
It would be logically invalid and unsound to have multiple frame allocators that could independently allocate chunks of physical memory from the same single physical address space. 
Unlike other multi-address space OSes, Theseus also has a single page allocator, because we only have one virtual address space. 
All pages must be allocated from that one space of virtual addresses, therefore only a single page allocator is needed.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-memory-types"><a class="header" href="#advanced-memory-types">Advanced memory types</a></h2>
<p>While the above &quot;basic&quot; types focus on preventing simple programmer mistakes through type-enforced clarity,
the below &quot;advanced&quot; types strive to prevent much more complex errors through type-specific invariants. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/page_allocator/struct.AllocatedPages.html"><code>AllocatedPages</code></a>: a range of <code>Page</code>s contiguous in virtual memory that have a single exclusive owner.
<ul>
<li>This can only be obtained by requesting an allocation from the <code>page_allocator</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/frame_allocator/struct.AllocatedFrames.html"><code>AllocatedFrames</code></a>: a range of <code>Frame</code>s contiguous in physical memory that have a single exclusive owner. 
<ul>
<li>This can only be obtained by requesting an allocation from the <code>frame_allocator</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory/struct.MappedPages.html"><code>MappedPages</code></a>: a range of virtually-contiguous pages that are mapped to physical frames and have a single exclusive owner. 
<ul>
<li>We will discuss <code>MappedPages</code> in the next section about memory mapping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between the basic types and advanced types is that the advanced types guarantee <em>exclusivity</em>.
As such, if you have a <code>PageRange</code> from <code>v0x6000</code> to <code>v0x8000</code>, there is nothing preventing another entity from creating a similar <code>PageRange</code> that overlaps it, e.g., from <code>v0x7000 to v0x9000</code>. 
However, if you have an <code>AllocatedPages</code> from <code>v0x6000</code> to <code>v0x8000</code>, you are guaranteed that <strong>no other entity across the entire system</strong> has an <code>AllocatedPages</code> object that contains any of those pages.
That is a powerful guarantee that allows us to build stronger isolation and safety invariants when allocating, mapping, and accessing memory, as shown in the next section.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mapping-virtual-memory-to-physical-memory"><a class="header" href="#mapping-virtual-memory-to-physical-memory">Mapping virtual memory to physical memory</a></h1>
<p>In order to actually <em>use</em> and <em>access</em> memory, you must map a virtual address to a physical address. 
You cannot access a physical address directly because the CPU expects to work with <em>virtual</em> addresses that will be auto-translated to physical addresses by the MMU and other memory controller hardware<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
Also, a virtual address is useless by itself; it doesn't have any content or purpose until you first map it to a real underlying physical address.</p>
<p>Memory mapping involves setting up a page table and establishing page table entries to represent the virtual-to-physical address mapping in a way that the MMU can understand.
As long as a mapping exists in the currently-active page table, you can access the contents in real physical memory by accessing a virtual address that is mapped to it. 
Accessing memory simply means dereferencing a pointer at a particular virtual address; a pointer is effectively a typed virtual addresses.</p>
<p>Attempting to access a virtual address that is not currently mapped will result in a <em>page fault</em>, a CPU exception that temporarily halts normal execution flow to allow a page fault handler in the OS to attempt to set up an appropriate page table entry for the non-mapped virtual address.
Using page faults is how on-demand paging is realized; Theseus currently does not do this because it goes against the <a href="subsystems/../design/idea.html#pie-principle">PHIS principle</a>.</p>
<p>Theseus's memory subsystem specifies three key types for mapping memory:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory/struct.Mapper.html"><code>Mapper</code></a>: provides functions to map virtual memory to physical memory, which create and return <code>MappedPages</code> objects.</li>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory/struct.PageTable.html"><code>PageTable</code></a>: a top-level page table, which owns the root frame of the page table and a <code>Mapper</code> instance that uses that page table frame to create new page table entries.
<ul>
<li>This auto-dereferences into a <code>Mapper</code>, allowing all <code>Mapper</code> functions to be called on a <code>PageTable</code> object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory/struct.MappedPages.html"><code>MappedPages</code></a>: an object that represents a range of virtually-contiguous pages that are mapped to physical frames and have a single exclusive owner. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Mapper</code> type implements the core two functions for mapping memory in Theseus:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>map_allocated_pages()</code>: maps a specific range of <code>AllocatedPages</code> to frames that are allocated on demand by the system at a random physical address.
<ul>
<li>Useful if you have some virtual pages and just want to use them for general purposes, and you don't care which physical memory gets mapped to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>map_allocated_pages_to()</code>: maps a specific range of <code>AllocatedPages</code> to a specific range of <code>AllocatedFrames</code>.
<ul>
<li>Useful if you need to access a hardware device or other memory that exists at a specific physical address.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The astute reader will notice that you can <em>only</em> map a range of exclusively-owned <code>AllocatedPages</code> to a range of exclusively-owned <code>AllocatedFrames</code>.
You cannot simply map a raw virtual address or page to a raw physical address or frame, they have to be specifically requested from the corresponding allocator and then mapped using the current active page table.
This is part of Theseus's solution to ensure that accessing <em>any</em> arbitrary region of memory is guaranteed safe at compile time.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>This assumes the CPU is in a standard mode like protected mode or long mode with paging enabled. The MMU can be disabled, after which virtual addresses do not exist and physical addresses can be directly used, but Theseus (and most other OSes) do not disable the MMU. </p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-mappedpages-type"><a class="header" href="#the-mappedpages-type">The <code>MappedPages</code> type</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory/struct.MappedPages.html"><code>MappedPages</code></a> type represents a region of virtually-contiguous pages that are <em>statically guaranteed</em> to be mapped to real physical frames (which may or may not be contiguous).
A <code>MappedPages</code> instance includes the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>The range of <code>AllocatedPages</code> that it owns and are currently mapped to </li>
<li>The permissions flags with which it was mapped, e.g., whether it is read-only, writable, cacheable, etc.</li>
<li>The root page table under which it was mapped, for extra safety and sanity checks.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>MappedPages</code> is the fundamental, sole way to represent and access mapped memory in Theseus; it serves as the backing representation for <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/stack/struct.Stack.html">stacks</a>, heaps, and other arbitrary memory regions, e.g., device MMIO and loaded cells.</p>
<h3 id="invariants-and-safety-guarantees-at-compile-time"><a class="header" href="#invariants-and-safety-guarantees-at-compile-time">Invariants and Safety Guarantees at Compile-time</a></h3>
<p>The design of <code>MappedPages</code> empowers the compiler's type system to enforce the following key invariants, extending Rust's memory safety checks to <em>all</em> OS-known memory regions, not just the compiler-known stack and heap.</p>
<ol>
<li>The mapping from virtual pages to physical frames must be one-to-one, or bijective.
<ul>
<li>Each <code>Page</code> can only be mapped to one <code>Frame</code>, and each <code>Frame</code> can only be mapped by a single <code>Page</code>, system-wide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A memory region must be unmapped exactly once, only after no outstanding references to it remain.</li>
<li>A memory region must not be accessible beyond its bounds.</li>
<li>A memory region can only be referenced as mutable or executable if mapped as such.</li>
</ol>
<p>These invariants integrate nicely with Rust's existing memory safety rules, such as preventing multiple invalid aliases (aliasing XOR mutability), out-of-bounds access, use after free and double free, and forbidden mutable access.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-mappedpages"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-mappedpages">How to use <code>MappedPages</code></a></h3>
<p>A key aspect of <code>MappedPages</code> is its &quot;access methods&quot; that allow callers to safely reinterpret the underlying mapped memory region as a particular type. 
Reinterpreting untyped memory is a crucial feature for any memory management subsystem; Theseus provides fully-safe interfaces to do so, while existing OSes do not. 
Reinterpretive casting is sometimes also referred to as &quot;struct overlay&quot;, as you're overlaying a struct on top of an existing memory region.</p>

<ul>
<li>The same is true for functions and executable memory regions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These methods all return <em>references</em> to the requested type or slice, in which the lifetime of the returned reference (<code>&amp;T</code>) is dependent upon the lifetime of the <code>MappedPages</code> object, in order to statically prevent use-after-free errors.
<ul>
<li>One cannot obtain an owned instance of a type <code>T</code> from an underlying <code>MappedPages</code> memory region, because that would remove the semantic connection between the type <code>T</code> and the existence of the underlying memory mapping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In comparison, other OSes typically return raw virtual address values from a memory mapping operation, which you must then unsafely cast to a typed pointer of your choice. 
With raw addresses, there is no lifetime guarantee to ensure that the mapping persists for as long as those virtual addresses are used. 
As such, Theseus removes at compile time the potential to easily cause unsafe, undefined behavior by using a raw virtual address after it has been unmapped.</p>
<p>For more details, see the Theseus paper from OSDI 2020, or Kevin Boos's dissertation, both <a href="subsystems/../misc/papers_presentations.html#selected-papers-and-theses">available here</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>MappedPages</code> type also exposes other convenient utility methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory/struct.MappedPages.html#method.remap"><code>remap()</code></a>: change the permissions flags for the virtual pages, which are still mapped to the same physical frames.</li>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory/struct.MappedPages.html#method.merge"><code>merge()</code></a>: combine multiple contiguous <code>MappedPages</code> objects into one.</li>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory/struct.MappedPages.html#method.unmap_into_parts"><code>unmap_into_parts()</code></a>: unmap the memory region and re-take ownership of its constituent parts (<code>AllocatedPages</code>, etc) for future use.
<ul>
<li>Without calling this, a <code>MappedPages</code> object will be auto-unmapped upon drop and its constituent parts deallocated for future use,
but that will happen behind the scenes without you being able to directly access them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also call any of the methods from <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/memory_structs/struct.PageRange.html"><code>PageRange</code></a> as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deallocating-frames"><a class="header" href="#deallocating-frames">Deallocating frames</a></h2>
<p>Deallocating virtual pages is easy because the range of <code>AllocatedPages</code> is directly stored in and owned by a <code>MappedPages</code> object, so it is simply a matter of deallocating them once they are dropped.</p>
<p>However, deallocating a range of <code>AllocatedFrames</code> is much more difficult because each page in a range of virtually-contiguous pages may likely be mapped to a different, non-contiguous set of frames.
This means we may have to deallocate many sets of <code>AllocatedFrames</code>, up to one per page.</p>
<p>In existing OSes, there is no way to easily and immediately determine which frames are mapped to which virtual pages; this requires a <em>reverse mapping</em> from <code>1</code> frame to <code>N</code> pages, which is prohibitively expensive to maintain.
As such, OS kernels typically run a periodic &quot;garbage collection&quot; thread on idle CPUs that sweeps the page tables to determine which frames can be reclaimed.</p>
<p>However, Theseus's design vastly simplifies the procedure of reclaiming unused physical frames for deallocation.
The single address space design and guaranteed bijective (1-to-1) mappings mean that a frame is mapped <em>exclusively</em> by a single page; when that page is no longer mapped to that frame, the frame can be deallocated.
We refer to this as exclusive mappings, and they are realized via a combination of several crates:</p>
<ol>
<li>When frame(s) are unmapped in the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/page_table_entry/index.html"><code>page_table_entry</code></a> crate, it creates an <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/page_table_entry/enum.UnmapResult.html"><code>UnmapResult</code></a> that may contain a set of <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/page_table_entry/struct.UnmappedFrames.html"><code>UnmappedFrames</code></a>.
<ul>
<li>The primary function of interest is <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/page_table_entry/struct.PageTableEntry.html#method.set_unmapped"><code>PageTableEntry::set_unmapped()</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using strong type safety, the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/frame_allocator/index.html"><code>frame_allocator</code></a> is able to accept a set of <code>UnmappedFrames</code> as a trusted &quot;token&quot; stating that the included frames cannot possibly still be mapped by any pages. It can therefore safely deallocate them.
<ul>
<li>Deallocation occurs seamlessly because an <code>UnmappedFrames</code> object can be converted into an <code>AllocatedFrames</code> object, <a href="https://www.theseus-os.com/Theseus/doc/frame_allocator/fn.init.html#return">see here for details and source</a>.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="heap-dynamic-memory-allocation"><a class="header" href="#heap-dynamic-memory-allocation">Heap: dynamic memory allocation</a></h1>
<p>Heaps are used to dynamically allocate chunks of memory smaller than the granularity of one page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: One can request a large allocation from the heap, but in Theseus it will be backed by an individually-created <code>MappedPages</code> object of newly-allocated pages and frames that are mapped to one another, so it's generally less efficient to use the heap for large allocations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Theseus, the primary purpose of the heap is to enable the usage of Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/"><code>alloc</code></a> types, e.g., <code>Box</code>, <code>Arc</code>, <code>Vec</code>, and other dynamically-allocated collections types.
Heap allocators must implement Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html"><code>GlobalAlloc</code></a> trait in order to be used as the backing allocator behind these <code>alloc</code> types.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-relevant-crates"><a class="header" href="#overview-of-relevant-crates">Overview of Relevant Crates</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/heap/index.html"><code>heap</code></a>: the default heap implementation that offers a static singleton fixed-size block allocator.
<ul>
<li>This is the first heap initialized and created during early OS boot.</li>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/block_allocator/struct.FixedSizeBlockAllocator.html"><code>block_allocator</code></a>: the underlying allocator implementation that optimizes allocations of common power-of-two sizes, e.g., 8 bytes, 32 bytes, etc.
<ul>
<li>Uses the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/linked_list_allocator"><code>linked_list_allocator</code></a> crate as a fallback for uncommon allocation sizes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/multiple_heaps/index.html"><code>multiple_heaps</code></a>: a more complex allocator that implements multiple heaps of arbitrary sizes and usage patterns.
<ul>
<li>Each internal heap instance is based on a zone allocator, which are modified versions of slab allocators from the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/slabmalloc"><code>slabmalloc</code></a> crate. </li>
<li>Unused heap space can easily be transferred among different internal heap instances for rapid, efficient heap growth.</li>
<li>Currently, one internal heap is created for each CPU core, with the core ID being used to identify and select which heap should be used for allocation.</li>
<li>It is trivially easy to use <code>multiple_heaps</code> in a different way, such as per-task heaps or per-namespace heaps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One unique aspect of Theseus's &quot;combination&quot; heap design is that the early heap, fully-featured heap, and per-core dedicated heaps are all combined into a single heap abstraction that can be accessed via a singleton global heap instance.
It starts out with the simple block allocator described above, and then, once more key system functionality has been initialized during OS boot, the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/multiple_heaps/fn.switch_to_multiple_heaps.html"><code>switch_to_multiple_heaps()</code></a> function is invoked to transparently activate the more complex, per-core heap allocators.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect of heaps in Theseus is that all entities across the system use and share the same set of global heaps. This allows allocations to seamlessly flow and be passed among applications, libraries, and kernel entities without the need for inefficient and complex <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/EuroSys2007_SealedProcesses.pdf">exchange heaps</a> used in other SAS OSes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Theseus's combination heap design was implemented before Rust's <code>alloc</code> types supported non-global allocators and placement constructors.</p>
<p>We haven't yet investigated how to break these heap instances down into individual allocators that can be used with specific allocation placement functions like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.new_in"><code>Box::new_in()</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in working on this, please file an issue on GitHub or otherwise contact the Theseus maintainers.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tasking-subsystem-in-theseus"><a class="header" href="#tasking-subsystem-in-theseus">Tasking Subsystem in Theseus</a></h1>
<p>The tasking subsystem in Theseus implements full support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking">multitasking</a>, 
in which multiple different tasks can execute concurrently<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>  atop a single set of shared resources, i.e., CPUs and memory.</p>
<p>Because Theseus is a single address space (SAS) OS, it does not have a dedicated address space for each task, and thus does not follow the classic POSIX/Unix-like &quot;process&quot; abstraction where a process is a group of threads that all execute the same program in the same address space.
One could consider tasks in Theseus to be the same as threads in other systems; the terms &quot;task&quot; and &quot;thread&quot; can be used interchangeably.
One could also consider the entirety of Theseus to be a single &quot;process&quot; in that all Tasks execute within the same address space, but the analogous similarities between a process and Theseus ends there. </p>
<p>In general, the interfaces exposed by the task management subsystem in Theseus follows the Rust standard library's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/">model for threading</a>, with several similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can spawn (create) a new task with a function or a closure as the entry point.</li>
<li>You can customize a new task using a convenient builder pattern.</li>
<li>You can wait on a task to exit by <a href="https://www.theseus-os.com/Theseus/doc/task/struct.JoinableTaskRef.html#method.join"><code>join</code></a>ing it.</li>
<li>You can use any standard synchronization types for inter-task communication, e.g., shared memory or channels.</li>
<li>You can catch the action of stack unwinding after a panic or exception occurs in a task.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, tasks in Theseus are effectively a combination of the concept of language-level green threads and OS-level native threads.</p>
<h2 id="the-task-struct"><a class="header" href="#the-task-struct">The <code>Task</code> struct</a></h2>
<p>There is one instance of the <code>Task</code> struct for each task that currently exists in the system.
A task is often thought of as an <em>execution context</em>, and the task struct includes key information about the execution of a given program's code.
Compared to that of other OSes, the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/struct.Task.html"><code>Task</code></a> struct in Theseus is quite minimal in size and scope,
because our state management philosophy strives to keep only states relevant to a given subsystem in that subsystem. 
For example, scheduler-related states are not present in Theseus's task struct; rather, they are found in the relevant scheduler crate in which they are used.
In other words, Theseus's task struct is not monolithic and all-encompassing.</p>
<p>Theseus's task struct includes several key items:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actual <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/context_switch/struct.Context.html"><code>Context</code></a> of the task's on-CPU execution.
<ul>
<li>This holds the values of CPU registers (e.g., the stack pointer and other registers) that are saved and restored when context switching between this task and others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The name and unique ID of that task.
<ul>
<li>These are used primarily for human readability and debugging purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The runnability (<a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/enum.RunState.html"><code>RunState</code></a>) of that task, i.e., whether it can be scheduled in, and its current running status.
<ul>
<li>This includes the task's <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/enum.ExitValue.html">exit value</a>, if it has exited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <em>namespace</em> that task is running within; see <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/mod_mgmt/struct.CrateNamespace.html"><code>CrateNamespace</code></a>.
<ul>
<li>Running tasks in different <code>CrateNamespace</code>s is one way to partially mimic the separation offered by the standard process abstraction; see <a href="subsystems/../design/design.html#cell--crate">here for more info</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The task's <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/stack/struct.Stack.html">stack</a>.</li>
<li>The task's <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/environment/struct.Environment.html">environment</a>, e.g., it's current working directory.</li>
<li>A variety of states related to handling execution failures and the cleanup of a failed task.
<ul>
<li>These are used for fault tolerance purposes like unwinding, task cleanup, and auto-restarting critical tasks upon failure. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: the source-level documentation for the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/struct.Task.html"><code>Task</code></a> struct describes each member field of the Task struct in much greater detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Task struct itself is split into two main parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Immutable state: things that cannot change after the initial creation of the Task.</li>
<li>Mutable state: things that <em>can</em> change over the lifetime of the Task.</li>
</ol>
<p>The immutable states are contained in the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/struct.Task.html"><code>Task</code></a> struct itself, while the mutable states are contained within the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/task/src/lib.rs#L237"><code>TaskInner</code></a> struct.
Each Task struct contains a <code>TaskInner</code> instance protected by a lock.
This design serves to significantly reduce locking overhead and contention when accessing the states of a Task in a read-only manner.
Note that certain mutable states, primarily runstate information, have been moved into <code>Task</code> itself because they can be safely modified atomically, but in general, all other mutable states are placed within <code>TaskInner</code>.
We are also careful to correctly specify the public visibility of state items within the <code>Task</code> and <code>TaskInner</code> structures to ensure that they cannot be modified maliciously or accidentally by other crates.</p>
<h3 id="the-taskref-type"><a class="header" href="#the-taskref-type">The <code>TaskRef</code> type</a></h3>
<p>Tasks frequently need to be shared across many entities and subsystems throughout Theseus. 
To accommodate this, Theseus offers the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/struct.TaskRef.html"><code>TaskRef</code></a> type, which is effectively a shared reference to a <code>Task</code>, i.e., an <code>Arc&lt;Task&gt;</code>. 
There are several reasons that we introduce a dedicated <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-04-advanced-types.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction"><code>newtype</code></a> instead of using an <code>Arc&lt;Task&gt;</code> directly:</p>
<ul>
<li>To clarify all code related to task management.</li>
<li>To control the visibility (public vs. private) of items in the Task struct.</li>
<li>To guarantee that the task-local data area (per-task data) is properly set up when a new Task is created.
<ul>
<li>A circular reference from a <code>Task</code> to its enclosing <code>TaskRef</code> is necessary to realize task-local data; see the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/task/src/lib.rs#L1085"><code>TaskLocalData</code></a> type for more details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To expose a limited set of functions that allow foreign crates to modify or query only certain task states, e.g., <code>join</code>ing a task.</li>
<li>To <em>greatly</em> optimize comparison and equality tests between two Tasks.
<ul>
<li>Two <code>TaskRef</code>s are considered equal if they point to the same underlying <code>Task</code> struct. </li>
<li>This avoids having to apply comparison tests against <em>all</em> fields in the <code>Task</code> struct, a very expensive operation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To prevent other entities from obtaining direct access to a <code>Task</code> struct, or wrapping a <code>Task</code> in a non-<code>Arc</code> shared pointer type.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: while <code>TaskLocalData</code> offers a very basic form of per-task data, commonly known as Thread-Local Storage (TLS), full support for standard compiler-known TLS areas in the generated object code is a work in progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-global-task-list"><a class="header" href="#the-global-task-list">The global task list</a></h3>
<p>Like all other OSes, Theseus maintains a global list of all tasks in the system.
Currently, this task list is stored as a map from a numeric task ID to a <code>TaskRef</code>.</p>
<p>Tasks are added to the task list when they are initially spawned, and will remain in the task list for the entirety of their lifecycle.
It is important to note that the presence of a task in the task list is not indicative of that task's runnability or execution status.
A task is only removed from the task list once it has been <em>reaped</em>, i.e., it has completely exited and its exit value has been &quot;taken&quot; by another task; for example, a &quot;parent&quot; task may reap a &quot;child&quot; task that it has spawned.</p>
<h2 id="context-switching"><a class="header" href="#context-switching">Context switching</a></h2>
<p>In OS terminology, the term &quot;context switch&quot; is often incorrectly overloaded and casually used to refer to any number of related topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Switching from one thread to another thread in the same address space.</li>
<li>Switching from one thread to another thread in a different address space.</li>
<li>Switching from user mode to kernel mode (e.g., Ring 3 to Ring 0) during a system call.</li>
<li>Switching from a user thread to a kernel thread upon an interrupt being triggered.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only number 1 above is what we consider to be a true context switch, and that is what we refer to here when we say &quot;context switch.&quot; 
Number 2 above is an <em>address space switch</em>, e.g., switching page tables, a different action that could potentially occur when switching to a different task, if the next task is in a different process/address space than the current task.
Number 3 above is a <em>mode switch</em> that generally does not result in the full execution context being saved or restored; only some registers may be pushed or popped onto the stack, depending on the calling convention employed by a given platform's system calls.
Number 4 above is similar to number 3, but is triggered by the hardware rather than userspace software, so more execution context states may need to be saved/restored. </p>
<p>One key aspect of context switching is that it is transparent to the actual code that is currently executing, as the lower layers of the OS kernel will save and restore execution context as needed before resuming.
Thus, context switching (with preemption) allows for multiple untrusted and uncooperative tasks to transparently share the CPU, while maintaining the idealistic model that they each are the only task executing in the entire system and have exclusive access to the CPU.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-context-switching"><a class="header" href="#implementing-context-switching">Implementing context switching</a></h3>
<p>The implementation for context switching in Theseus is split across several crates, with each crate corresponding to a particular subset of SIMD instructions being enabled.
The top-level <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/context_switch/index.html"><code>context_switch</code></a> crate automatically selects the correct version based on which subset of SIMD functionality is chosen by the target hardware platform's specification.
For example, if SSE2 was enabled, <code>#[cfg(target_feature = &quot;sse2&quot;)]</code> would be true and the <code>context_switch_sse2</code> crate would be used as the context switching implementation.
Currently, one can select this target by using the <code>x86_64-unknown-theseus-sse</code> target while building Theseus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">make run TARGET=x86_64-unknown-theseus-sse
</code></pre>
<p>Theseus supports both SSE2 and AVX, but its default target <code>x86_64-unknown-theseus</code> disables both.
This tells the compiler to generate soft floating-point instructions instead of SIMD instructions, meaning that the SIMD register set is not used at all.
Thus, disabling SIMD results in the simplest and fastest version of context switching, as only the basic set of general-purpose CPU registers must be saved and restored; all SIMD registers can be ignored.</p>
<p>Context switching is inherently an unsafe operation, hence why the standard <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/context_switch_regular/fn.context_switch_regular.html"><code>context_switch()</code></a> function is marked unsafe.
It must be implemented in assembly in order to ensure that the compiler doesn't insert any instructions that modify register values in between our instructions that save/restore them.
It is only invoked by the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/fn.task_switch.html"><code>task_switch()</code></a> function, as only that function has the proper information — saved register values and the destination for the restored register values — to correctly invoke it.</p>
<h2 id="pre-emptive-vs-cooperative-multitasking"><a class="header" href="#pre-emptive-vs-cooperative-multitasking">Pre-emptive vs. Cooperative Multitasking</a></h2>
<p>Theseus implements full support for preemptive multitasking, in which a given task is interrupted at a certain periodic time interval in order to allow other tasks to take over execution.
This prevents one greedy task from hogging all system resources and/or starving other tasks from execution time.
In Theseus, like most other systems, we implement this using a timer interrupt that fires every few milliseconds on each CPU core.
The length of this time period is called the <em>timeslice</em>, and is a configurable setting.
Currently, this timer interrupt is set up in the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/apic/struct.LocalApic.html"><code>LocalApic</code></a> initialization routine, which runs when each CPU core is discovered and initialized.
The interrupt handler itself is very simple, and is currently found in a function called <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/interrupts/src/lib.rs#L380"><code>lapic_timer_handler()</code></a> in <code>kernel/interrupts/src/lib.rs</code>.</p>
<p>Cooperative multitasking is also possible, but at the moment Theseus does not offer an easy way to disable preemption to use <em>only</em> cooperative multitasking; however, it wouldn't be difficult to add.
Currently, tasks can choose to yield the processor to other tasks by invoking <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/scheduler/fn.schedule.html"><code>schedule()</code></a>, which will select another task to run next and then switch to it.
This scheduling function is the same function that is invoked by the aforementioned timer interrupt handlers to preempt the current task every few milliseconds.</p>
<h2 id="the-task-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#the-task-lifecycle">The Task lifecycle</a></h2>
<p>Theseus tasks follow a typical task lifecycle, which is in-part demonstrated by the possible variants of the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/enum.RunState.html"><code>RunState</code></a> enum. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initializing</strong>: the task is being created.
<ul>
<li>After the task is finished being created and is fully spawned, its runstate will be set to Runnable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Runnable</strong>: the task is able to be scheduled in (but is not necessarily currently executing).
<ul>
<li>A runnable task may be <em>blocked</em> to prevent it from being scheduled in until it is subsequently unblocked.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: &quot;running&quot; and &quot;runnable&quot; are not the same thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>A task is considering runnable after it has spawned and before it has exited, as long as it is not blocked.</li>
<li>A task is only said to be <em>running</em> while it is currently executing on a given CPU core, and is merely considered runnable when it is waiting to be scheduled in whilst other tasks execute.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Blocked</strong>: the task is blocked on some other condition and is not able to be scheduled in.
<ul>
<li>A blocked task may be <em>unblocked</em> to mark it as runnable again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exited</strong>: the task is no longer executing and will never execute again.
<ul>
<li>An exited task has an <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/enum.ExitValue.html"><code>ExitValue</code></a>, which is one of:
<ul>
<li>Completed -- the task ran to completion normally and finished as expected.</li>
<li>Killed -- the task stopped executing prematurely as a result of a crash (language-level panic or machine-level exception) or as a result of a kill request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An exited task must not cleaned up until ist has been &quot;reaped&quot; (see below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reaped</strong>: the task has exited and its <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/enum.ExitValue.html"><code>ExitValue</code></a> has been taken by another <code>Task</code>.
<ul>
<li>A task is cleaned up and removed from the system once it has been reaped.</li>
<li>An exited task will be auto-reaped by the system if no other task is waiting on it to exit.
See <a href="https://www.theseus-os.com/Theseus/doc/task/struct.JoinableTaskRef.html"><code>JoinableTaskRef</code></a> for more info on how this works.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spawning-new-tasks"><a class="header" href="#spawning-new-tasks">Spawning new Tasks</a></h3>
<p>The functionality to spawn (create) a new task is implemented in a separate <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/spawn/index.html"><code>spawn</code></a> crate.
Theseus provides a <code>TaskBuilder</code> interface to allow one to customize the creation of a new task, which starts with a call to <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/spawn/fn.new_task_builder.html"><code>new_task_builder()</code></a>.
The caller must pass a function and argument when spawning a task: the function is the entry point for the task, and the argument will be passed to that entry point function.
Once the task builder has been used to suitably customize the new task, one must invoke the <code>spawn()</code> method on the <code>TaskBuilder</code> object to actually create the new <code>Task</code> instance and add it to one or more runqueues.
This does not immediately execute the task, but rather only makes it eligible to be scheduled in during the next task switch period.</p>
<p>The function passed into the spawn routine is actually not the first function to run when the task is first switched to.
All new tasks have the same entry point, the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/spawn/src/lib.rs#L500"><code>task_wrapper()</code></a> function, which simplifies the procedure of jumping into a new task:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up the proper stack contents</li>
<li>Invoking the task's entry function with the proper argument</li>
<li>Catching panics and exceptions during unwinding</li>
<li>Handling the task's states after it has exited, whether a completion or failure.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cleaning-up-tasks"><a class="header" href="#cleaning-up-tasks">Cleaning up Tasks</a></h3>
<p>The <code>Task</code> struct implements Rust's <code>Drop</code> trait, meaning that once all references to a Task have ended, the Task object itself can be dropped and cleaned up.
Because Tasks are more complex than most structures, the drop handler alone isn't sufficient to properly clean up and remove all traces of that task and the effects that it has had on the system.</p>
<p>The clean up procedure begins after a task exits, either by running to completion or being killed upon request or after encountering a panic or exception.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the task ran to completion, the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/spawn/src/lib.rs#L500"><code>task_wrapper()</code></a> will call <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/spawn/src/lib.rs#L547"><code>task_cleanup_success()</code></a>, a function that marks the task as having successfully exited and stores the returned <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/enum.ExitValue.html"><code>ExitValue</code></a> in its <code>Task</code> struct.</li>
<li>If the task did <em>not</em> finish, the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/spawn/src/lib.rs#L500"><code>task_wrapper()</code></a> will call <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/spawn/src/lib.rs#L587"><code>task_cleanup_failure()</code></a>, a function that marks the task as having encountered a failure, and stores the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/task/enum.KillReason.html">reason</a> that it was prematurely killed in its <code>Task</code> struct.</li>
</ul>
<p>After handling the successful or failed exit condition, the last piece of the task lifecycle is the <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/d6b86b6c46004513735079bed47ae21fc5d4b29d/kernel/spawn/src/lib.rs#L631"><code>task_cleanup_final()</code></a> function, which removes the task from any runqueues it may be on, drops the final reference to that task, and then re-enables interrupts and yields the processor.
That final task reference, when dropped, triggers the aforementioned drop handler for the Task struct, which automatically releases all of its acquired states and allocated resources.
Note that the procedure of stack unwinding accomplishes the release of most resources and allocations, since those are represented by owned values that exist on the program's stack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: there are a separate set of similar task lifecycle functions for critical system tasks that were spawned as <em>restartable</em>. The primary difference is that after the cleanup actions are completed, a new task is spawned with the same entry point and initial argument as the failed task. </p>

<p>Multitasking on a uniprocessor machine (with a single CPU core) is not <em>truly</em> concurrent, it just appears to be concurrent over a given time interval because the execution of multiple tasks is quickly interleaved.
True concurrency can be achieved on a multiprocessor machine, in which different tasks execute simultaneously on different cores.</p>

<p>Theseus enforces several key invariants related to task management in order to empower the compiler to uphold memory safety and prevent resource leaks throughout the task lifecycle.</p>
<p>All task lifecycle functions leverage the same set of generic type parameters. 
The trait bounds on these three type parameters <code>&lt;F, A, R&gt;</code> are a key aspect of task-related invariants.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>F</code>: the type of the entry function, i.e., its signature including arguments and return type.</li>
<li><code>A</code>: the type of the single argument passed into the entry function <code>F</code>.</li>
<li><code>R</code>: the return type of the entry function <code>F</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="invariant-1-spawning-a-new-task-must-not-violate-memory-safety"><a class="header" href="#invariant-1-spawning-a-new-task-must-not-violate-memory-safety">Invariant 1. Spawning a new task must not violate memory safety.</a></h2>
<p>Rust already ensures this for multiple concurrent userspace threads, as long as they were created using its standard library thread type.
Instead of using the standard library, Theseus provides its own task abstraction, overcoming the standard library’s need 
to extralingually accommodate unsafe, platform-specific thread interfaces, e.g. <code>fork()</code>. 
Theseus does not offer fork because it is known to be unsafe and unsuitable for SAS systems<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">1</a></sup>, 
as it extralingually duplicates task context, states, and underlying memory regions without reflecting that aliasing at the language level.</p>
<p>Theseus’s task abstraction preserves safety similarly to and as an extension of Rust threads. 
The interfaces to spawn a new task (in the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/spawn/index.html">spawn</a> crate) require specifying the exact type of the entry
function <code>F</code>, its argument <code>A</code>, and its return type <code>R</code>, with the following constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>The entry function <code>F</code> must be runnable only once, meaning it must satisfy the <code>FnOnce</code> trait bound.</li>
<li>The argument type <code>A</code> and return type <code>R</code> must be safe to transfer between threads, meaning they must satisfy the <code>Send</code> trait bound.</li>
<li>The lifetime of all three types must outlast the duration of the task itself, meaning they must have a <code>'static</code> lifetime.</li>
</ol>
<p>All <a href="subsystems/./task.html#the-task-lifecycle">task lifecycle management functions</a> are fully type-safe and parameterized with the same generic type parameters, <code>&lt;F,A,R&gt;</code>. 
This ensures both the compile-time availability of type information and the <em>provenance</em> of that type information from head to tail (spawn to cleanup) across all stages in the task's lifecycle.
Theseus thus empowers the compiler to statically prevent invalidly-typed task entry functions with arguments, return values, or execution semantics that violate type safety or memory safety.</p>
<h2 id="invariant-2-all-task-states-must-be-released-in-all-possible-execution-paths"><a class="header" href="#invariant-2-all-task-states-must-be-released-in-all-possible-execution-paths">Invariant 2: All task states must be released in all possible execution paths.</a></h2>
<p>Releasing task states requires special consideration beyond simply dropping a Task object to prevent resource leakage, as mentioned in the previous chapter.
There are several examples of how the multiple stages of task cleanup each permit varying levels of resource release:</p>
<ul>
<li>The task's stack is used during unwinding and can only be cleaned up once unwinding is complete.</li>
<li>The saved execution <code>Context</code> can be released when a task has exited.</li>
<li>A task's runstate and exit value must persist until it has been reaped.</li>
</ul>
<p>The task cleanup functions described in the <a href="subsystems/./task.html#cleaning-up-tasks">previous chapter</a> demonstrate the lengths to which Theseus goes to ensure that task states and resources are fully released in both normal and exceptional execution paths. 
In addition, as mentioned above, all cleanup functions are parameterized with the same <code>&lt;F, A, R&gt;</code> generic type parameters, 
which is crucial for realizing restartable tasks because the failure handler for a restartable task must know its specific type parameters for the entry function, argument, and return type in order to re-spawn a new instance of the failed task.</p>
<h2 id="invariant-3-all-memory-transitively-reachable-from-a-tasks-entry-function-must-outlive-that-task"><a class="header" href="#invariant-3-all-memory-transitively-reachable-from-a-tasks-entry-function-must-outlive-that-task">Invariant 3: All memory transitively reachable from a task’s entry function must outlive that task.</a></h2>
<p>Although all memory regions in Theseus are represented by <code>MappedPages</code>, which prevents use-after-free via lifetime invariants,
it is difficult to use Rust lifetimes to sufficiently express the relationship between a task and arbitrary memory regions it accesses.
The Rust language does not and cannot specify a task-based lifetime, e.g., <code>&amp;'task</code>, to indicate that the lifetime of a given reference is tied to the lifetime of the current task.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Rust program running as a task cannot specify in its code that its variables bound to objects in memory are tied to the lifetime of an underlying <code>MappedPages</code> instance, as they are hidden beneath abstractions like stacks, heaps, or static program sections (.text, .rodata, etc).
Even if possible, this would be highly unergonomic, inconvenient, and render ownership useless.
For example, all local stack variables would need to be defined as borrowed references with lifetimes derived from that of the <code>MappedPages</code> object representing the stack.</p>
<p>Thus, to uphold this invariant, we instead establish a clear chain of ownership: 
each task owns the <code>LoadedCrate</code> that contains its entry function,
and that <code>LoadedCrate</code> owns any other <code>LoadedCrate</code>s it depends on by means of the per-section dependencies in the crate metadata.
As such, the <code>MappedPages</code> regions containing all functions and data reachable from a task’s entry function are guaranteed
to outlive that task itself. 
This avoids the unsavory solution of littering lifetime constraints across all program variables, allowing Rust code to be written normally with the standard assumption that the
stack, heap, data, and text sections will always exist.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> the display subsystem in Theseus is in need of complete redesign. It is inefficient and poorly implemented, as it was simply a means to the end of being able to interact with the system, and unfortunately has not been a focus of any significant effort.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-the-window-manager-works"><a class="header" href="#how-the-window-manager-works">How the Window Manager works</a></h1>
<h2 id="design"><a class="header" href="#design">Design</a></h2>
<p>Typically, both the application that owns/creates a window and the window manager that controls that window need to access it jointly. The application needs to display its content into the main part of the window, and the window manager needs information about the location and depth ordering of all windows to render them. </p>
<p>To share a window between an application and the window manager, the application holds a strong reference (<code>Arc</code>) to the window, while the window manager holds a weak reference (<code>Weak</code>) to that same window. This allows the window manager to control an manage a window without conceptually owning it.</p>
<p>We use a <code>Mutex</code> to wrap each window to allow the application task and window manager task to safely access it jointly. However, <code>Mutex</code> introduces the possibility of deadlock: when an application wants to access its window, it must acquire the <code>Mutex</code> lock, operate on the window, and then release the lock. If the application doesn't release the lock on its window, the window manager will be forced to block until the lock is released, preventing it from performing typical operations like switching between windows, delivering events, or deleting windows.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we define two structures: <code>Window</code> and <code>WindowInner</code>. <code>WindowInner</code> only contains the information required by the window manager. The window manager holds a list of references to <code>WindowInner</code> objects, while only the application owns the outer <code>Window</code> object (which itself does contain a reference to the underlying WM-owned <code>WindowInner</code> object. The <code>Window</code> struct also contains other application-relevant states that describe the window.</p>
<h2 id="the-windowinner-structure"><a class="header" href="#the-windowinner-structure">The <code>WindowInner</code> structure</a></h2>
<p>The <code>window_inner</code> crate defines a <code>WindowInner</code> structure. It has states and methods of displaying the window on the screen.</p>
<p>A <code>WindowInner</code> has a framebuffer to which it can display the content of the window. The framebuffer takes a type parameter of pixels it consists of. When the window is rendered to the screen, a compositor may composite every pixel with different principles according to the type. Currently, we have implemented a normal RGB pixel and a pixel of an alpha channel.</p>
<p>Both an application's window and the window manager has a reference to the same <code>WindowInner</code> object. The application can configure and draw in the framebuffer and the manager can display and composite the window with others.</p>
<p>This structure also has an event producer. The window manager gets events from I/O devices such as keyboards and push them to the corresponding producer.</p>
<h2 id="window"><a class="header" href="#window">Window</a></h2>
<p>A <code>Window</code> object represents a window and is owned by an application. It contains its profile, a title, a consumer and a list of displayables. The consumer can get events pushed to the producer in its profile by the manager.</p>
<p>A <code>Window</code> provides methods to display the displayables in it and render itself to the screen. The window manager is responsible for compositing it with other windows through a framebuffer compositor.</p>
<h2 id="displayables"><a class="header" href="#displayables">Displayables</a></h2>
<p>The <code>displayable</code> crate defines a <code>Displayable</code> trait. A <code>Displayable</code> is an item which can display itself onto a framebuffer. It usually consists of basic graphs and acts as a component of a window such as a button or a text box. Currently, we have implemented a <code>TextDisplay</code> which is a block of text. In the future, we will implement other kinds of displayables.</p>
<p>An application can own multiple displayables and display any type of <code>Displayable</code> in its window.</p>
<h2 id="the-windowmanager"><a class="header" href="#the-windowmanager">The WindowManager</a></h2>
<p>The <code>window_manager</code> crate defines a <code>WindowManager</code> structure. This structure consists of the profiles of an active window, a list of shown windows and a list of hidden windows. The hidden ones are totally overlapped by others. The structure implements basic methods to manipulate the list such as adding or deleting a window.</p>
<p>The <code>WindowManager</code> structure contains a bottom framebuffer which represents the background image and a final framebuffer of a floating window border and a mouse arrow. In refreshing an area, it renders the framebuffers in order background -&gt; hidden list -&gt; shown list -&gt; active -&gt; top. It provides several methods to update a rectangle area or several pixels for better performance.</p>
<p>The structure defines a loop for generic events, a loop for keyboard events and a loop for mouse events. Theseus will initialize them as tasks to handle inputs. The window manager structure provides methods to operate on the window list as reactions to these inputs. It can move a window when we drag it with mouse or pass other events to the active window. The owner application of the active window can handle these events.</p>
<p>The <code>window_manager</code> crate owns a <code>WINDOW_MANAGER</code> instance which contains all the existing windows. It invokes the methods of <code>WindowManager</code> to manage these windows.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-to-create-windows-and-display-content"><a class="header" href="#how-to-create-windows-and-display-content">How to Create Windows and Display Content</a></h1>
<h2 id="create-a-window"><a class="header" href="#create-a-window">Create a Window</a></h2>
<p>An application invokes the <code>Window::new()</code> function in the <code>window</code> crate to create a new window. The function would create a new <code>Window</code> object and add a weak reference of its <code>WindowInner</code> to the <code>WINDOW_MANAGER</code> instance in <code>window_manager</code>. It then returns the window to the application. Once the application terminates, the window it owns would be dropped automatically, and the weak reference in the window manager would be deleted.</p>
<h2 id="display-in-a-window"><a class="header" href="#display-in-a-window">Display in a Window</a></h2>
<p>An application can create a <code>Displayable</code> and invoke <code>Window.display()</code> to display it. This method is generic and works for all kinds of displayables.</p>
<p>After display a displayable in its framebuffer, the window would invoke its <code>render()</code> method to render the updates to the screen. A framebuffer compositor will composite a list of framebuffers and forward the result to a final framebuffer which is mapped to the screen.</p>
<h2 id="handle-key-inputs"><a class="header" href="#handle-key-inputs">Handle Key Inputs</a></h2>
<p>An application invokes <code>Window.handle_event()</code> to handle the events sent to it. For example, an active window will receive all the key input events. An application can invoke <code>Window.handle_event()</code> in a loop to handle these inputs from the keyboard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="running-theseus-on-virtual-or-real-hardware"><a class="header" href="#running-theseus-on-virtual-or-real-hardware">Running Theseus on Virtual or Real Hardware</a></h1>
<p>We have tested whether Theseus runs properly in a variety of environments, currently on x86_64 only:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual machine emulators: QEMU, bochs, VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player.</li>
<li>Real hardware: Intel NUC devices, Supermicro servers, various Thinkpad laptops, PCs with Gigabyte motherboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the primary limiting factor is that the device support booting via USB or PXE using traditional BIOS rather than UEFI; support for UEFI is a work-in-progress. </p>
<p>Note that as Theseus is not fully mature, booting on your own hardware is done at your own risk. Be sure that you have a backup of all of your important files before doing so. </p>
<p>If you experience a problem booting Theseus on any virtual or real hardware platform, please take a look at <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/issues/">the open issues on GitHub</a> to see if someone has already reported your problem or attempted to fix it.

<p>Using a virtual machine emulator is by far the easiest way to develop, test, and run Theseus. </p>
<h2 id="qemu"><a class="header" href="#qemu">QEMU</a></h2>
<p>Our primary test environment and recommended emulator is <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a>, which is the default choice for running Theseus using our built-in Makefile commands. 
For example, the <code>make run</code> target automatically runs Theseus in a QEMU virtual machine after it finishes the build process. </p>
<p>The top-level Makefile specifies the configuration parameters for Theseus in QEMU, such as system memory, attached storage devices, serial log output, and more. 
All of these parameters start with <code>QEMU_</code> and can be overridden on the command line, or indirectly by setting environment variables such as <code>net</code> or <code>host</code>, or by editing the Makefile itself.</p>
<h2 id="bochs"><a class="header" href="#bochs">Bochs</a></h2>
<p>In older versions of Theseus, we used both <a href="https://bochs.sourceforge.io/">Bochs</a> and QEMU for testing. Bochs is supported but its configuration may be out of date; the configuration is found in the <code>bochsrc.txt</code> (<a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/theseus_main/bochsrc.txt">direct link</a>) file in the root repository directory.</p>
<p>Bochs runs quite slowly and supports virtualization of far fewer hardware devices than QEMU; thus, we do not recommend using it. However, you can try running Theseus in Bochs using the Makefile target for it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">make bochs
</code></pre>
<h2 id="vmware-workstation-player"><a class="header" href="#vmware-workstation-player">VMware Workstation Player</a></h2>
<p>We have tested Theseus on VMWare Workstation and it generally works out of the box. However, there are some options that you may wish to enable to improve performance and offer access to more devices in Theseus. </p>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">download VMware Workstation Player here</a>, which can be installed and used for free for non-commercial work. </p>
<p>On Linux, you will download a <code>.bundle</code> file, which then needs to executed in a terminal. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">chmod +x VMware-Player-&lt;...&gt;.bundle
sudo ./VMware-Player-&lt;...&gt;.bundle

<li>Click <code>Create A New Virtual Machine</code>.</li>
<li>In the New Virtual Machine Wizard window, choose <code>Use ISO image:</code> and browse to select the Theseus ISO image, which should be located in the <code>build</code> directory, e.g., <code>build/theseus-x86_64.iso</code>. Then, click <code>Next</code>.</li>
<li>Under <code>Guest Operating System</code>, choose the <code>Other</code> button and then <code>Other 64-bit</code> from the drop-down menu. Then, click <code>Next</code>.</li>
<li>Set the <code>Name:</code> field to &quot;Theseus&quot; or whatever you prefer. Click <code>Next</code>.</li>
<li>Disk size doesn't matter; click <code>Next</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Customize Hardware</code>, and then select the following settings:
<ul>
<li>512MB of memory (less may work, but the minimum is on the order of 10-20 MB).</li>
<li>2 or more processor cores.</li>
<li>Select <code>Virtualize CPU performance counters</code> if you want to use them (not required).</li>
<li>If you want to obtain Theseus's log output, then you need to add a serial port connection:
<ol>
<li>Click <code>Add...</code> on the bottom left to add a new hardware type, then <code>Serial Port</code>.</li>
<li>Under <code>Connection</code>, select <code>Use output file:</code> and then choose a destination file name for the serial log to be written to. For example, <code>/home/your_user/theseus_vmware.log</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Save</code>. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <code>Finish</code>, and then <code>Close</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Theseus should boot up after a few seconds. You can view the serial log output by <code>cat</code>ting or opening the file:</p>

<li>Under <code>System</code> in the left sidebar, go to the <code>Processor</code> tab and select 2 (or more) processors.</li>
<li>If you want to obtain Theseus's log output, then you need to add a serial port connection:
<ol>
<li>Click <code>Serial Ports</code> in the left sidebar, under the <code>Port 1</code> tab, select the <code>Enable Serial Port</code> checkbox.</li>
<li>Under the <code>Port Mode</code> drop-down menu, select <code>Raw File</code> option.</li>
<li>In the <code>Path/Address</code> text box, type the destination file name for the serial log to be written to. For example, <code>/home/your_user/theseus_vbox.log</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Ok</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In the main window, select the Theseus VM entry from the left sidebar and then click <code>Start</code> on the top bar. </li>

<p>PCI passthrough can be used to allow a guest OS to directly access a physical device.
The following instructions are a combination of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=vfio-host-setup">this</a> guide on host setup for VFIO passthrough devices and <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vfio.txt">this</a> kernel documentation on VFIO.</p>
<p>There are three main steps to prepare a device for PCI passthrough:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find device information</li>
<li>Detach device from current driver</li>
<li>Attach device to VFIO driver</li>
</ol>
<p>Once these steps are completed, the device slot information can be passed to QEMU using the <strong>vfio</strong> flag. For example, for device 59:00.0, we run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">make run vfio=59:00.0
</code></pre>
<h3 id="finding-device-information"><a class="header" href="#finding-device-information">Finding device information</a></h3>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="running-theseus-on-headless-systems-interactively"><a class="header" href="#running-theseus-on-headless-systems-interactively">Running Theseus on Headless Systems Interactively</a></h1>
<p>By default, Theseus expects to run in a standard desktop environment with a basic graphical display (monitor) and a real keyboard (and optionally, a mouse). 
For interacting with the system, Theseus uses the keyboard as its primary input and the graphical display as its primary output.</p>
<p>Theseus can also run in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer">headless mode</a>, in which the &quot;head&quot; of the computer (its monitor and keyboard) are nonexistent, and I/O is done over the network or a serial port connection.
This is useful for system environments like servers, embedded microcontrollers, certain virtual machine environments, and anything else without a monitor display.</p>
<p>The current version of Theseus listens for incoming connections on serial ports only (COM1 and COM2).
Upon receiving data (like a key press) on a serial port, Theseus will spawn a terminal emulator to handle I/O on that port. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: headless interactive mode can coexist simultaneously with regular graphical display mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TODO: describe the various options for disabling hardware graphical displays</p>
<h2 id="connecting-a-terminal-emulator-to-theseus"><a class="header" href="#connecting-a-terminal-emulator-to-theseus">Connecting a Terminal Emulator to Theseus</a></h2>
<p>Currently, we have tested this with only virtual serial ports connected to Theseus through a VMM like QEMU, but it should also work for real hardware serial ports.</p>
<p>While Theseus is running in a VM or on another physical machine, we recommend using a terminal emulator program on the host machine to connect to the serial port device on the Theseus machine.
Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>screen</code></li>
<li><code>picocom</code></li>
<li><code>minicom</code></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the Theseus Makefile starts QEMU with two serial ports, COM1 and COM2, that the host machine can connect to and exchange data over. 
The first serial port, COM1, is connected to the <code>stdio</code> streams of the terminal that spawned the QEMU process. 
This stream is used for the system log and for controlling QEMU, so it is best to use COM2 to interact with Theseus separately such that the headless virtual terminal is not polluted with log statements.
The second serial port, COM2, is connected to a dynamically-allocated pseudo-terminal (PTY) that will be allocated by QEMU. To connect to it, inspect the QEMU output when it first starts to find a line like this:</p>
<pre><code>char device redirected to /dev/pts/3 (label serial1-base)
</code></pre>
<p>This tells you that QEMU connected the second serial port (COM2) on the guest Theseus VM to the Linux PTY device at <code>/dev/pts/3</code>. 
Note that QEMU uses 0-based indexing for serial ports, so its &quot;serial1&quot; label refers to the second serial port, our &quot;SERIAL2&quot; (COM2 on x86).</p>
<p>Now, once QEMU is running, you can connect a terminal emulator on the host to the serial port in Theseus, and Theseus will issue interactive commands to that terminal emulator.
To do so, run any of the following commands and then press any key to start the terminal prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>screen /dev/pts/3</code></li>
<li><code>picocom /dev/pts/3</code></li>
<li><code>minicom -D /dev/pts/3</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some programs (namely <code>minicom</code>) do not necessarily send the expected value when pressing the <code>Backspace</code> key. 
Thus, if you are experiencing unexpected behavior when pressing <code>Backspace</code>, you need to ensure that your program is sending the correct ASCII <code>DEL</code> (0x7F) character value when pressing <code>Backspace</code>, instead of an ASCII <code>BS</code> (0x08), which will only move the cursor to the left by one character.
In our experience, <code>screen</code> and <code>picocom</code> work as expected, but <code>minicom</code> does not. 
To change <code>minicom</code>'s default behavior, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <code>Ctrl + A</code> twice to open the meta control bar at the bottom of the screen</li>
<li>Press <code>T</code> to open the &quot;Terminal Settings&quot; menu</li>
<li>Press <code>B</code> to toggle the &quot;Backspace key sends&quot; setting.
<ul>
<li>You want this to be <code>DEL</code>, not <code>BS</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Either of these serial ports can be changed in QEMU using the environment variables <code>SERIAL1</code> and <code>SERIAL2</code> respectively, though again, we recommend only using <code>SERIAL2</code> in virtual environments.
In real hardware, where there is only one serial port and therefore COM1 must be used, you can disable the log or initialize it with a different serial port, e.g., COM2, to avoid polluting the terminal emulator connected to COM1 with system log printouts.</p>

<p>To boot over USB, simply run</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">make boot usb=sdc
</code></pre>
<p>in which <code>sdc</code> is the device node for the USB disk itself <em>(<strong>not a partition</strong> like sdc2)</em>.
The OS image (.iso file) will be written to that USB drive.</p>
<p>On WSL or other host environments where <code>/dev</code> device nodes don't exist, you can simply run <code>make iso</code> and burn the <code>.iso</code> file in the <code>build/</code> directory to a USB drive. 
For example, on Windows we recommend using <a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> to burn ISOs.</p>
<p>Then, once the bootable USB is ready, plug it into your PC, restart or power on the machine, and choose that USB device from the BIOS or legacy boot device screen.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="booting-theseus-on-real-hardware-via-pxe"><a class="header" href="#booting-theseus-on-real-hardware-via-pxe">Booting Theseus on Real Hardware via PXE</a></h1>
<p>The following instructions are a combination of <a href="https://www.ostechnix.com/how-to-install-pxe-server-on-ubuntu-16-04/">this guide on OSTechNix</a> to set up PXE for Ubuntu and <a href="https://wellsie.net/p/286/">this guide by Andrew Wells</a> on how to use any ISO with PXE.</p>
<p>PXE can be used to load Rust onto a target computer that is connected by LAN to the host machine used for development. To set up the host machine for PXE, first make the Theseus ISO by navigating to the directory Theseus is in and running:
<code>make iso</code></p>
<p>Then, you will need to set up a TFTP and DHCP server which the test machine will access.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-tftp-server"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-the-tftp-server">Setting up the TFTP Server</a></h2>
<p>First, install all necessary packages and dependencies for TFTP:
<code>sudo apt-get install apache2 tftpd-hpa inetutils-inetd nasm</code>
Edit the tftp-hpa configuration file:
<code>sudo nano /etc/default/tftpd-hpa</code>
Add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>RUN_DAEMON=&quot;yes&quot;
OPTIONS=&quot;-l -s /var/lib/tftpboot&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, edit the <code>inetd</code> configuration file by opening the editor:
<code>sudo nano /etc/inetd.conf</code>
And adding:
<code>tftp    dgram   udp    wait    root    /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot</code></p>
<p>Restart the TFTP server and check to see if it's running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo systemctl restart tftpd-hpa
sudo systemctl status tftpd-hpa
</code></pre>
<p>If the TFTP server is unable to start and mentions an in-use socket, reopen the tftp-hpa configuration file,set the line that has <code>TFTP_ADDRESS=&quot;:69&quot;</code> to be equal to <code>6969</code> instead and restart the TFTP server.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-dhcp-server"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-the-dhcp-server">Setting up the DHCP Server</a></h2>
<p>First, install package for DHCP server:
<code>sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server</code></p>
<p>Then run <code>ifconfig</code> to view available networking devices and find the network device name, e.g., <code>eth0</code>.</p>
<p>Edit the <code>/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server</code> configuration file and add the network device name from the step above to &quot;INTERFACES&quot;. For me, this looks like <code>INTERFACES=&quot;eth0&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Configure an arbitrary IP address that will be used in the next step:
<code>sudo ifconfig &lt;network-device-name&gt; 192.168.1.105</code>
This command might have to be done each time the computer being used as a server is restarted.</p>
<p>Edit the <code>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</code> file by uncommenting the line <code>authoritative;</code> and adding a subnet configuration such as the one below:</p>
<pre><code>subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.1.20 192.168.1.30;
  option routers 192.168.1.1;
  option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
  default-lease-time 600;
  max-lease-time 7200;
}

allow booting;
allow bootp;
option option-128 code 128 = string;
option option-129 code 129 = text;
next-server 192.168.1.105;
filename &quot;pxelinux.0&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Restart the DHCP server and check to see if it's running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
</code></pre>
<h2 id="loading-the-theseus-iso-into-the-tftp-server"><a class="header" href="#loading-the-theseus-iso-into-the-tftp-server">Loading the Theseus ISO Into the TFTP Server</a></h2>
<p>In order for the TFTP server to load Theseus, we need the Theseus ISO and a memdisk file in the boot folder. To get the memdisk file first download syslinux which contains it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/syslinux-5.10.tar.gz
tar -xzvf syslinux-*.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>Then navigate to the memdisk folder and compile.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd syslinux-*/memdisk
make memdisk
</code></pre>
<p>Next, make a TFTP boot folder for Theseus and copy the memdisk binary into it along with the Theseus ISO:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo mkdir /var/lib/tftpboot/theseus
sudo cp /root/syslinux-*/memdisk/memdisk /var/lib/tftpboot/theseus/
sudo cp /Theseus/build/theseus-x86_64.iso /var/lib/tftpboot/theseus/
</code></pre>
<p>Navigate to the PXE configuration file:
<code>sudo nano /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default</code>
And add Theseus as a menu option by adding the following:</p>
<pre><code>label theseus
    menu label Theseus
    root (hd0,0)
    kernel theseus/memdisk
    append iso initrd=theseus/theseus-x86_64.iso raw
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, restart the DHCP server one more time and make sure it's running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
</code></pre>
<p>On the target computer, boot into the BIOS, turn on Legacy boot mode, and select network booting as the top boot option. Once the target computer is restarted, it should boot into a menu which displays booting into Theseus as an option.</p>
<h2 id="subsequent-pxe-uses"><a class="header" href="#subsequent-pxe-uses">Subsequent PXE Uses</a></h2>
<p>After setting up PXE the first time, you can run <code>make pxe</code> to make an updated ISO, remove the old one, and copy the new one over into the TFTP boot folder. At that point, you should be able to boot that new version of Theseus by restarting the target computer. If there are issues restarting the DHCP server after it worked the first time, one possible solution may be to confirm that the IP address is the one you intended it to be with the command from earlier:
<code>sudo ifconfig &lt;network-device-name&gt; 192.168.1.105</code></p>

<p><em>Code for others how you wish they would code for you.</em></p>
<p>What does this mean? You should adhere to the following principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Good abstractions.</strong> Another developer using your code should never have to study the internals of the code itself,
but rather be able to fully understand how to use your code simply from its struct/function names and documentation.
Use intuitive names and try to design an interface that makes sense, is simple and easy to use, and doesn't surprise anyone with unnecessary trickery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be clean.</strong> Write well-crafted, concise code with sufficient features to be useful, but without bloat.
Adhere to code style conventions, including proper spacing, doc comments, naming conventions, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Foolproof code.</strong> Think carefully about how others will use your code,
and design it thoughtfully to prevent others from making mistakes when using your code,
ideally prevented at compile time instead of runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Errors are important!</strong>  Handle errors gracefully and thoroughly,
and return detailed error messages that clearly describe the issue. <em>Don't ever let something fail silently!</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some other good practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Accurate metadata.</strong>  In addition to good code and documentation, make sure to fill in additional metadata,
such as the details present in each crate's <code>Cargo.toml</code> file: description, keywords, authors, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No &quot;magic&quot; numbers.</strong> Do not use literal number values that have no documentation or explanation of why they exist.
For example, instead of just writing a value like 4096 in the code, create a <code>const</code> that accurately describes the semantic meaning of that value, e.g., <code>const PAGE_SIZE: usize = 4096;</code>.
Magic numbers are terrible to maintain and don't help anyone who looks at your code in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize global states.</strong> Remove static (global) states as much as possible, and rethink how the same data sharing can be done without globals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rust-specific-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#rust-specific-guidelines">Rust-specific Guidelines</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rust style.</strong> Follow proper Rust coding style and naming conventions. Use correct spacing, indentation, and alignment that matches the existing style.
Make your code visually appealing, with spaces between operators like equal signs, addition, spaces after a comma, etc. Punctuation is important for legibility!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rust documentation.</strong> Use proper rustdoc-style documentation <em>for all structs, functions, and types.</em>
Make sure all of your documentation links are correct, and that you're using the correct rustdoc formatting for doc comments.
Triple slashes <code>///</code> should be used above function and struct definitions, double slashes <code>//</code> for C-style inline comments (or block comments like <code>/* */</code>), and <code>//! </code> for crate top-level documentation.
Use Markdown formatting to describe function arguments, return values, and include usage examples, in a way consistent with Rust's official libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>Option</code>s and <code>Result</code>s.</strong> Use Options and Results properly. Don't use special values that have overloaded meanings, e.g., an integer in which <code>0</code> means no value, or something like that.
<a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling/">Here's a good resource</a> for better understanding error handling in Rust.</p>
<p><code>Option</code>s should be returned when an operation might fail, but that failure condition doesn't affect the rest of the system.
For example, if you're searching for an element in a list, then an <code>Option</code> is the suitable choice because the caller of your getter function would only call it in order to get and use the return value.</p>
<p><code>Result</code>s should be returned if something can fail or succeed, and the caller needs to know whether it succeeded, but potentially need the actual return value, e.g., an init function that returns void.
In this case, <code>Result</code> is the best choice because we want to force the caller to acknowledge that the init function succeeded, or handle its error if it failed.
In Theseus, <code>Results</code> are mandatory when a function has some side effect, such as setting a parameter or value that might not exist or be initialized yet.
In that case, a result must be used to indicate whether the function succeeded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theseus-specific-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#theseus-specific-guidelines">Theseus-specific Guidelines</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Handle <code>Result</code>s properly and fully.</strong> Don't ignore a result error, instead, log that error and then handle it if possible.
If you cannot handle it, return that error to the caller so they can attempt to handle it. <strong>NEVER SILENCE OR LAZILY HIDE ERRORS</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Never use unsafe code.</strong> If you absolutely cannot avoid it, then you should review your case on an individual basis with the maintainers of Theseus. In most cases, unsafe code is not necessary and can be rewritten in safe code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-new-functionality-to-theseus"><a class="header" href="#adding-new-functionality-to-theseus">Adding New Functionality to Theseus</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to add new functionality is just to create a new crate by duplicating an existing crate and changing the details in its new <code>Cargo.toml</code> file.
At the very least, you'll need to change the <code>name</code> entry under the <code>[package]</code> heading at the top of the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file, and you'll need to change the dependencies for your new crate.</p>
<p>If your new kernel crate needs to be initialized, you can invoke it from the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/captain/index.html"><code>captain::init()</code> function</a>,
although there may be more appropriate places to do so, such as the <a href="https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/doc/device_manager/index.html"><code>device_manager</code>'s functions</a> for initializing device drivers.</p>
<p>If you want to create a new application for Theseus, see <a href="contribute/../app/app.html">those instructions here</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="advice-for-contributing-and-using-git"><a class="header" href="#advice-for-contributing-and-using-git">Advice for Contributing and using git</a></h1>
<p>The main Theseus repository, <a href="https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus"><code>theseus-os/Theseus</code></a> is what we call the <em>upstream</em>.
To contribute, you should create your own fork of that repository through the GitHub website, and then check out your own fork.
That way, your fork will be the <code>origin</code> remote by default, and then you can add the upstream as another remote by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git remote add upstream https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus
</code></pre>
<h3 id="never-push-to-the-main-branch"><a class="header" href="#never-push-to-the-main-branch">Never push to the main branch</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the main branch on the upstream <code>theseus-os/Theseus/theseus_main</code> is protected from a direct push. 
This is true even for GitHub users who are in the <code>theseus-os</code> organization and have write access to the Theseus repo.
The only way to contribute to it is by merging a pull request into the main branch, which only authorized users can do.
Instead, checkout your own fork as above, create a new branch with a descriptive name, e.g., <code>kevin/logging_typo</code>,
develop your feature on that branch, and then submit a pull request.
This is a standard Git workflow that allows people can review your code, check for pitfalls and compatibility problems,
and make comments and suggestions before the code makes its way into the main branch.
<em>You must do this for all changes, even tiny ones that may seem insignificant.</em></p>
<h3 id="submitting-a-pull-request"><a class="header" href="#submitting-a-pull-request">Submitting a pull request</a></h3>
<p>To submit a pull request (PR), go to the GitHub page of your forked Theseus repo,
select the branch that you created from the drop down menu, and then click &quot;New pull request&quot;.
By default, GitHub will create a new PR that wants to merge your branch into the upstream <code>theseus_main</code> branch,
which is usually what you want to do.
Now, give your PR a good title and description, scroll down to review the commits and files changed,
and if everything looks good, click &quot;Create pull request&quot; to notify the maintainers that you have contributions that they should review.</p>
<h3 id="review-your-own-work"><a class="header" href="#review-your-own-work">Review your own work</a></h3>
<p>Perform an initial review of your own code before submitting a pull request.
Kindly don't place the whole burden of fixing a bunch of tiny problems on others that must review your code too.
This includes building the documentation and reviewing it in HTML form in a browser (<code>make view-doc</code>)
to make sure everything is formatted correctly and that hyperlinks work correctly.</p>
<h3 id="double-check-commit-contents"><a class="header" href="#double-check-commit-contents">Double-check commit contents</a></h3>
<p>When making a commit, review your changes with <code>git status</code> and <code>git diff</code>, as well as on the GitHub comparison page, to ensure that you're not committing accidental modifications or editing files that you shouldn't be.
This makes the maintainers' lives a lot easier, meaning your PR is more likely to be accepted.</p>
<p>You don't need to worry about having too many small commits, as we will squash (combine) all of your PR's commits into a single large commit when merging it into the upstream main branch.</p>
