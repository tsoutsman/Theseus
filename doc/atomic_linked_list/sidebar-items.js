A generic, singly-linked list data structure that is lock-free  and uses `AtomicPtr`s to ensure safety in the face of multithreaded access. Each node remains in the same spot in memory once it is allocated, and will not be reallocated, which allows an external thread to maintain a reference to it safely  (but really, only a Weak reference is safe to maintain, to catch possible Node deletion)."],["atomic_map","A basic map structure which is backed by an atomic linked list.
