For example, a single 2-D point (`Coord`) offers no real room for optimization  because only one pixel will be composited, but a rectangle does allow for optimization, as a large chunk of pixels can be composited all at once."],["Compositor","A compositor composites (combines or blends) a series of “source” framebuffers onto a single “destination” framebuffer.  The type parameter `B` allows a compositor to support multiple types of regions or “bounding boxes”,  given by the trait bound `CompositableRegion`."]]};
