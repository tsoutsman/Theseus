Fix is as follows if virtual address matches. `new_address` = `old_address` - `start_address_of_old_text_region` + `start_address_of_new_text_region`. Address ranges are provided via `SwapRanges` struct. Uses unsafe logic for pointer manipulation"],["do_self_swap","For swapping of a crate from the identical object file in the disk.
